### Nut

- Bone nut
- Graph Tech TUSQ nut

### Shielding

- No shielding in:
	- Control cavity
	- Pickup and wiring routs
	- Underside of pickguard
- Can use garden slug repellant adhesive-backed copper foil

### Bridge saddles

- Can use Tele/Strat saddles

### Pots/caps/jack

- Complete wiring harness includes all of these, and doesn't require soldering pickups
	- Gunstreet
	- Obsidian
- Might be able to tighten the output jack myself
- Replace tone knobs with bass roll-off knobs like in Reverend guitars

### PIckups

- Don't need f-spaced/trembucker pickups since there's no tremolo
- Push/pull for coil split would be nice
	- Stock humbuckers only have two leads, so would need new pickups if I wanted to do this
- Phase switch?
