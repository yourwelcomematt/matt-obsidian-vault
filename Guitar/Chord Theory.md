## Major Chords

Inversions
* Tonic note in the bass = root position
* Third in the bass = 1st inversion
* Fifth in the bass = 2nd inversion

Suspended chords
- Third is replaced with the fourth = sus 4
- Third is replaced with the second = sus 2

Add 6 chords
- Adds the sixth to the major triad (i.e., the root note of the relative minor chord - e.g., F# for A major)
- Can be used within a song or as a distinctive final chord

Add 9 chords
* Adds the ninth to the major triad

6/9 chords
* Adds the sixth + ninth to the major triad
* Sometimes used to conclude a song

Major 7 chords
- Adds the seventh to the major triad

Major 9 chords
* Adds the ninth to a major 7 chord

Dominant 7th chords
- Lowers the seventh by one semitone
- Bluesy feel
- Provides a stepping stone to the 4 chord
- 7+9 chord raises the 9th by one semitone (augmentation) - also called the Hendrix chord

Dominant 9 or 11 or 13 chords
- Jazzy extensions of a dominant 7th
	- Dominant 7th + 9th = 9 chord
	- Dominant 7th + 9th + 11th = 11 chord
		- Most commonly used as the V chord at the end of a chord progression
		- Can be thought of as a slash chord when the 3rd and 5th are omitted (e.g., B flat 11 can also be called A flat / B flat, as the dominant 7th, 9th, and 11th form an A flat triad)
	- Dominant 7th + 9th + 11th + 13th = 13 chord
- Strictly speaking all of the specified notes must be included, however this can make the chord sound muddy and can be difficult to play
- In practice you can just have the root, 7th, and specified scale degree, or omit the 3rd and 5th
- The extension notes can also be modified (e.g., 7 flat 9, 7 sharp 9, 9 sharp 11, etc.)

## Minor Chords

Minor 9 chords
- Same as a M9 chord just with the minor third

## Diminished Chords

- Made entirely of notes separated by minor thirds (three semitones)
- When used on the 5 chord in a major key, it resolves nicely to the tonic chord

## Augmented Chords

- Made entirely of notes separated by major thirds (four semitones)
- Usually accomplished by raising the fifth of the chord by one semitone

## Power Chords

- Made entirely of root notes and fifths (no major or minor third)

# Chord Movements

Secondary dominant chords
- A secondary dominant chord is the dominant chord a fifth away from the chord we want to resolve to in a given key that is not the i chord
- ii chord
	- Major dominant 7 version of vi chord
- iii chord
	- Major dominant 7 version of vii chord
- vi chord
	- Major dominant 7 version of the I chord
- v chord
	- Major dominant 7 version of the ii chord
- vi chord
	- In a major key, you can use the major dominant 7 version of the iii chord to resolve to the vi chord (e.g., in the key of G, use a B7 to resolve to Em)
	- Can also be used in a minor key
- You can just use a major chord instead of the dominant 7 chord, but it won't have as much resolving tension
- You also don't just have to resolve down to the chord a fifth below - you can resolve to another chord (e.g., in Creep where the III chord resolves to the IV chord)
