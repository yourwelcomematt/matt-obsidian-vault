## Major Chords

Inversions
* Tonic note in the bass = root position
* Third in the bass = 1st inversion
* Fifth in the bass = 2nd inversion

Suspended chords
- Third is replaced with the fourth = sus 4
- Third is replaced with the second = sus 2

Add 6 chords
- Adds the sixth to the major triad (i.e., the root note of the relative minor chord - e.g., F# for A major)
- Can be used within a song or as a distinctive final chord

Add 9 chords
* Adds the ninth to the major triad

6/9 chords
* Adds the sixth + ninth to the major triad
* Sometimes used to conclude a song

Major 7 chords
- Adds the seventh to the major triad

Major 9 chords
* Adds the ninth to a major 7 chord

Dominant 7th chords
- Lowers the seventh by one semitone
- Bluesy feel
- Provides a stepping stone to the 4 chord
- 7+9 chord raises the 9th by one semitone (augmentation) - also called the Hendrix chord

Dominant 9 or 11 or 13 chords
- Jazzy extensions of a dominant 7th
	- Dominant 7th + 9th = 9 chord
	- Dominant 7th + 9th + 11th = 11 chord
		- Most commonly used as the V chord at the end of a chord progression
		- Can be thought of as a slash chord when the 3rd and 5th are omitted (e.g., B flat 11 can also be called A flat / B flat, as the dominant 7th, 9th, and 11th form an A flat triad)
	- Dominant 7th + 9th + 11th + 13th = 13 chord
- Strictly speaking all of the specified notes must be included, however this can make the chord sound muddy and can be difficult to play
- In practice you can just have the root, 7th, and specified scale degree, or omit the 3rd and 5th
- The extension notes can also be modified (e.g., 7 flat 9, 7 sharp 9, 9 sharp 11, etc.)

## Minor Chords

Minor 9 chords
- Same as a M9 chord just with the minor third

## Diminished Chords

- Made entirely of notes separated by minor thirds (three semitones) - basically a minor triad with a flattened fifth
- Signified with a degree mark or "dim"
- The vii chord in a major key is always a diminished chord, however it's rarely used as it's basically an incomplete V7 chord which doesn't resolve as strongly to the tonic chord
- The ii chord in a minor key is always a diminished chord
- Used mainly as transition chords that resolve nicely to the next chord in the progression
	- Can resolve to any nearby major or minor chord
	- Can be used on the V# chord to move from V -> vi (e.g., in the key of C it would be G -> G#dim -> Am)
	- Also used on the IV# chord to move from IV -> V or to resolve to the I chord 2nd inversion
	- When used on the V chord in a major key, it resolves nicely to the tonic chord
- There are three kinds of 7 chords for diminished chords:
	- Diminished major 7
	- Diminished dominant 7, which is usually written as m7(b5) -> commonly used as the ii chord in a ii V I progression in a minor key
	- Diminished 7, which has a double flat 7
- Can't be inverted

## Augmented Chords

- Made entirely of notes separated by major thirds (four semitones)
- Usually accomplished by raising the fifth of a major chord by one semitone
- Signified with a + symbol or "aug"
- Most commonly used to resolve up a 4th to another chord
	- Used on the V chord to resolve up to the I chord (alternative to a dominant 7, which gives a feeling of resolving down)
	- Used on the I chord to resolve up to the IV chord (e.g., I, I+, IV, iv)
- Can also be used to resolve to any chord that contains the sixth scale degree, which the raised fifth wants to resolve to (e.g., the vi chord)
- Can't be inverted (e.g., C+/E is just E+)

## Power Chords

- Made entirely of root notes and fifths (no major or minor third)

# Chord Movements

Secondary dominant chords
- A secondary dominant chord is the dominant chord a fifth away from the chord we want to resolve to in a given key that is not the i chord
- Resolving to the ii chord
	- Major dominant 7 version of vi chord
- iii chord
	- Major dominant 7 version of vii chord
- vi chord
	- Major dominant 7 version of the I chord
- v chord
	- Major dominant 7 version of the ii chord
- vi chord
	- In a major key, you can use the major dominant 7 version of the iii chord to resolve to the vi chord (e.g., in the key of G, use a B7 to resolve to Em)
	- Can also be used in a minor key
- You can just use a major chord instead of the dominant 7 chord, but it won't have as much resolving tension
- You also don't just have to resolve down to the chord a fifth below - you can resolve to another chord (e.g., in Creep where the III chord resolves to the IV chord)

Line cliches
* Staying on a given chord but moving the lowest or highest note down or up a semitone each time
* E.g., F -> Am/E -> Adim/Eb is just moving the lowest note down a semitone
