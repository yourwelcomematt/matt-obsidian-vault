## Fretboard

- Replace the strings!
- Polish the frets - Jim Dunlop has a polishing kit
- Can use #0000 steel wool
- Be careful of getting metal shavings on the pickups - put painters tape over them and wipe down the guitar before removing
- A fret dress is required if the frets are worn down from the strings
- Nourish the fretboard (not maple) with lemon oil or wax to stop it from drying out and give it a nice colour

## Strings

- Don't stretch them out heaps - just give them a small tug near the middle, otherwise you'll stretch out the winding of the strings and cause them to deteriorate faster
- Pete says to do a small tug near the nut and near the bridge
- May need to check the bow of the neck again depending on your chosen gauge of strings
- "It actually does help to wind the string UP on the tuning pegs for “3 a side” headstocks such as a Les Paul. I can’t remember where I heard it, but after trying it, the slightly shallower angle of the string by winding up does greatly increase tubing stability, most notably on the D and G string."

## Neck

- Bowed outwards (concave) = high action
- Bowed inwards (convex) = low action and fret buzz
- Too straight = low action and fret buzz
- Aim for a slight concave dip
- Look down the body and neck to see the bow of the neck
- Adjust the truss rod with an allen key (can buy a set of these)
- Loosen it to allow the neck to go outwards
- Small adjustments are key - check after each one
- Do it until you reach your desired action

## Nut

- A sticky nut is the number one cause of tuning issues
- Clean out any gunk in the nut slots (toothpick?)
- Big Bends Nut Sauce (lol) lubricates the nut slots and the strings as they go through them
- Can also use pencil lead, as the graphite acts as a lubricant
- After re-stringing the guitar, loosen the strings enough to pull them out of the nut slots, then apply the lubricant
- Put a little bit in each nut slot after 

## Pickups

- The closer the pickup is to the string, the louder it will be, and vice versa
- Adjust the pickup height using the screws on either side

## Bridge

- String height and action
- Intonation
