	- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
	- ¼ tsp salt
	- ½ tsp sugar
	- 1/8 tsp white pepper powder

1) Cut tofu into triangles 1cm thick and pan fry on medium heat for 5-8 minutes until evenly golden-brown on the bottom, then flip and fry for another 5 minutes and remove
2) Get the wok piping hot and shut off the heat (longyau)

	a) Add ½ tbsp of oil if using pork belly, or 2-3 tbsp if not, and swirl to give the wok a non-stick surface
	b) Switch to medium heat and fry the pork belly for 3 minutes until the oil has rendered out

3) Shut off the heat and add the doubanjiang, then switch to medium-low heat and fry for 2-3 minutes until the oil combines with the paste and reseparates, resulting in a red oil
4) Add the aromatics in, switch to medium high heat, and stir-fry for 30 seconds
5) Swirl the Shaoxing wine around the sides of the wok and give it a super brief mix
6) Add the tofu in and give it a super brief mix
7) Add the mushrooms in and give it a super brief mix
8) Add the sauce and switch to high heat to bring to a boil
9) Let it boil uncovered for 5 minutes, or until reduced by ¼
10) Add the green chili / capsicum and green garlic / spring onion, mix, and continue to cook for 30 seconds (5-10 seconds for spring onion)
11) Add the corn starch slurry in to thicken the sauce
12) Add MSG, give it a quick mix, and turn off the heat
