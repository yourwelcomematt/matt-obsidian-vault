	- 0.50 green bell pepper
	- 4 dried chili peppers
	- 2 cloves garlic
- Beef marinade
	- 1 tsp baking soda
	- 1 tbsp cornstarch
	- 2 tbsp water
	- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
	- 1 tsp light soy sauce
	- 1 tsp dark soy sauce
	- 0.25 tsp white pepper powder
	- 1 tbsp oil (pre-cooking)
	- 1 tbsp cornstarch (pre-cooking)
- Sauce
	- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
	- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
	- 0.50 tsp dark soy sauce
	- 0.50 tsp chili sauce (Lee Kum Kee Guilin Chili Sauce)
	- 1 tsp sugar

- Cooking
	- 28.3 g oil (to be added first)
	- 56.7 g oil (to be added second)
	- 1 tbsp sesame oil

## Method

1) Cut the beef into thin slices against the grain
2) Rinse the beef in cold water to remove redness and press to remove the excess
3) Combine the marinade ingredients and mix with the beef
4) Cut onion and capsicum into slices, green onion into 1-inch pieces (separate white from green), and mince the garlic
5) Combine the sauce ingredients and set aside
6) Once the beef has absorbed the marinade, and in the pre-cooking oil and mix, then add in the pre-cooking corn starch and mix
7) Turn the stove to high heat and let the wok heat up until it’s just about to smoke or barely smokes
8) Add the first lot of cooking oil and swirl to coat the wok, then add the second lot of cooking oil and let it heat up for about a minute (you may need longer depending on how hot your stove can get – test one piece of beef first and you should see immediate bubbling)
9) Cook the beef in the oil for about 1.5 minutes – it should be cooked through and a little crispy
10) Turn off the stove and remove the beef from the wok, making sure to let the oil drain off as you do – keep this oil so you can reuse it in the future
11) The oil that’s remaining in the wok should be enough to cook the rest of the dish
12) Turn the stove back on to high heat and add the garlic, dried chili pepper, onion, green onion whites, and capsicum, and fry for 1-1.5 minutes until they’re fragrant and cooked through
13) Add the beef back in and fry for ~20 seconds
14) Add the sauce and green onion greens and fry for ~30 seconds
15) Turn off the heat and finish by drizzling sesame oil in and mixing
16) Serve!
