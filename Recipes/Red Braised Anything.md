- 2 cups hot water for meat, 1 cup for anything else
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 tsp dark soy sauce
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp five spice powder, or whole spices (recommend cinnamon, star anise, and three others)
	- 1/4 stick cinnamon
	- 1 star anise
	- 2 cloves
	- 1 bay leaf
	- 1/4 tsp whole Sichuan peppercorns
	- 1/4 tsp fennel seeds
	- 1 Chinese black cardamom
	- 1 licorice root
	- 1 dried chili

## Method

1. Pre-cook your main ingredient
	1. Meat (pork, beef, chicken, etc): add to cool water, bring to a boil, boil for three minutes, then rinse.
	2. For anything else (tofu, potato, eggplant, fish, hard boiled eggs, etc), pre-fry it until 'done'. 
	3. Tofu: five minutes each side
	4. Potatoes: ~10 minutes over a medium flame.
2. Fry the aromatics over medium flame for ~15 seconds
3. If using five spice powder, add it and fry for another ~30 seconds until fragrant
4. Add your main ingredient
	1. If using meat, you can fry it for a bit longer to get some browning, 3-5 minutes
5. Swirl in the Shaoxing wine.
6. Add the hot water, soy sauces, sugar, and whole spices (if using)
7. Cover and simmer on low until the main ingredient is tender (45 minutes for meat and 10 minutes for anything else)
8. Uncover, swap flame to high and let everything rapidly reduce (liquid should be ~1/3 of the original volume)
9. Taste, then season with salt and MSG
10. Thicken by adding the slurry in - one third at first so as to not overthicken. You're looking for the consistency of a thin sauce. 
11. Drizzle with the sesame oil and sprinkle over the scallion greens.
