## Ingredients

- 3 cups kidney beans
- 1 litre water (plus extra as needed)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 4 sprigs spring onion
- 1 Thai chili (optional)
- 2 cups coconut milk
- 3 tbsp cold-pressed coconut oil
- Salt
- 1/2 tsp curry powder
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 cup diced tomato w/ seeds removed (can sub w/ 1 tbsp tomato paste)
- 1 cup diced green capsicum
- Pinch of chili flakes
- 1 & 1/2 cups chopped shallots
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tbsp minced ginger

## Method

1) Soak the beans for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight)
2) Wash the beans, then add them to a pot and cover with water (around 1 inch)
3) Add the cloves of garlic, 1/3 of the shallots, spring onion, and Thai chili and boil with the lid on for 45 minutes or until mashable
4) Remove the spring onion and chili
5) Add enough water so that when you move the beans, you can see the broth - you don't need to be able to see it when the beans are at rest
6) Add 2 tsp of salt and mix, then set the beans aside
7) In a separate pot, add the coconut oil and saute the garlic and ginger for around 30 seconds or until fragrant, then add the rest of the shallots and cook until translucent
8) Add 1 tsp of salt, the black pepper, chili flakes, and curry powder, and cook for 1 minute
9) Add the capsicum and tomatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes or until the tomatoes start to disentegrate - we're looking for a chutney-like texture
10) Add the beans and stir to combine
11) Add the coconut milk and stir to combine into a creamy broth
12) Simmer until thickened to the desired consistency (the author cooks it for another 10 minutes with the lid on)
