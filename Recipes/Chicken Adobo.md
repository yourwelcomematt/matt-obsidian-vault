## Ingredients

- Approx 1kg chicken thighs (not breast)
- 1 medium onion (diced)
- Spring onion for garnish
- Marinade
	- 1/3 cup soy sauce
	- 1/3 cup rice vinegar
	- 2 tbsp brown sugar
	- 3 cloves garlic
	- 1 tsp doubanjiang
	- Lots of black pepper
	- Shake chilli flakes
	- 2 bay leaves (or you can substitute with a shake of thyme)
	- 2 cups water

## Method

1) Combine chicken and marinade ingredients in a bowl. You don’t have to leave to marinate but ideally you would - for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.
2) Heat 1 tbsp oil in a deep pan over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned – about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.
3) Remove chicken and set aside.
4) Add more oil into the pan. Add onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.
5) Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.
6) Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.
7) Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice with spring onions.
