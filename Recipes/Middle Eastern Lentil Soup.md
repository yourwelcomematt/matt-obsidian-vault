## Ingredients

- 2 cups of dried lentils, rinsed and drained
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1 teaspoon of ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon of ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon of ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon of paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
- 6 cups of vegetable or chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons of tomato paste
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Method

1) Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large pot and saut√© the onions and garlic for 5 minutes until they become translucent.
2) In the pot, add and stir the spices: cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper for 1-2 minutes to release their aroma.
3) In the pot, stir the onion and spice mixture before adding the rinsed and drained lentils. This will coat the lentils in the mixture.
4) Stir together the broth and tomato paste, and combine them well.
5) Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 30-40 minutes until the lentils become tender, and the soup thickens.
6) Use an immersion blender or transfer half of the soup to a blender and puree until smooth.
7) Return the pureed soup to the pot and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
8) Add the lemon juice to the soup and stir well.
9) Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley.
