## Ingredients

- 750g beef brisket or shank (shin) cut into 1 inch x 1 1/2 inch pieces
- 2 inches ginger, sliced in half and gently smashed
- Aromatics
	- 1/2 leek cut into cylinders
	- 1 inch ginger roughly minced
	- 3 cloves garlic roughly minced
- Spices
	- 1 cinnamon stick
	- 2 star anise
	- 4 dried chilis
	- 2 bay leaves
	- 1/2 tsp coriander seeds
- Seasoning
	- 3 tbsp light soy sauce
	- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
	- 1 tbsp sugar
- 300g potato cut into 1 inch chunks and soaked in cold water
- 1/4 tsp salt

## Method

1) Cut beef into 1 inch x 1 1/2 inch pieces
2) Cover beef with cold water, add smashed ginger, cover, and bring to a boil on high heat
3) Once at a rapid boil, skim out the gunk into a bowl, then transfer the beef and ginger into another bowl
4) Add beef and ginger to a dry wok or pot over medium-high heat, and toast for ~3 minutes until the beef is dry and a bit browned
5) Move the beef to the side, add 1 tbsp of oil, add garlic and ginger, let fry for 10 seconds, then mix and fry everything together for 1 minute
6) Transfer to a braising pot if necessary and add 1 litre water, leek, spices, and seasoning, cover, and stew for 1 hour on a low simmer
7) Check the water level 30 minutes in and top up if needed to keep everything submerged
8) After 1 hour the beef should be tender enough to poke through with a chopstick
9) Add potatoes, remove leek, cover and cook on medium-high heat for 15 minutes
10) Uncover, give everything a mix, and cook until reduced and thickened to a sauce-like consistency (while stirring occasionally) - around 10 minutes
11) Season with salt, mix, cook for another minute, and serve
