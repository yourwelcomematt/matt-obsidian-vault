## Ingredients

- 500g soft or medium tofu
- 80g minced beef or pork
- 5 tbsp cooking oil (preferably virgin rapeseed oil or Indian mustard seed oil)
- 1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns
- 3 tbsp doubanjiang (Juan Cheng Pai brand recommended)
- 2 tbsp chili flakes (can reduce to 1 tbsp)
- 1 tbsp douchi (black fermented beans – can omit if you don’t have it)
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 inches ginger
- 1 cup stock (we usually use chicken) or water
- 1-2 stalks green garlic or spring onion
- Seasoning
	- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
	- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine
	- ¼ tsp MSG (can sub with salt)
	- ¼ tsp white pepper powder
	- ½ tbsp toasted sesame oil
- Slurry of 1 tbsp corn starch mixed with 1-2 tbsp of water

## Method

1) Slice the tofu into 1-inch cubes
2) Get enough water to submerge the tofu up to a boil and add in ¼ tsp of salt
3) Lower the water to a heavy simmer and add in the tofu, simmering for 3 minutes to remove the slight grassy taste and firm it up a touch, then take it off the heat and leave it until it needs to be added
4) Toast the Sichuan peppercorns for 1-2 minutes over a medium-low flame until they start to leave little oil splotches on the side of the wok, then grind into a powder
5) Slice the green garlic or spring onion into 1-inch sections, roughly chop the douchi, and mince the garlic, ginger, and doubanjiang
6) Get the wok hot enough so that steam is coming off of it, shut off the heat, add in the oil and give it a swirl to give a non-stick surface
7) Heat the oil on medium-high until bubbles start to form around a pair of chopsticks
8) Fry the mince for four minutes, or until it is super crispy and the oil is clear again
9) Shut off the heat, move the mince to the side, and add in the doubanjiang
10) Fry the doubanjiang on medium-low heat for ~90 seconds to colour and flavour the oil
11) Add the douchi in and give it a quick mix
12) Add the garlic and ginger in and give it a quick mix
13) Add in the chilli flakes and fry everything together for ~1 minute until you have a nice and even paste
14) Add in the stock
15) Drain the tofu and add
16) Increase the heat to medium-high and bring it up to a heavy simmer
17) Simmer for ~7 minutes or until reduced by 1/3, moving the tofu around to prevent it from sticking
18) Add in the seasoning and mix
19) Add in half of the slurry and allow it to thicken – if it hasn’t thickened enough add more
20) Add in the green garlic or spring onion, give it a mix, and cook for ~30 seconds for the former and ~15 seconds for the latter
21) Sprinkle the Sichuan peppercorn powder and mix it in, then turn the heat off and dish up
22) The red oil should float to the top after 5-10 minutes

To make the dish vegetarian:
- Skip the mince
- Use water instead of stock (or use vegetable stock)
- Double the MSG
