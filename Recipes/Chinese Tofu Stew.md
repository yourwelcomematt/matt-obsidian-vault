## Ingredients

- 1 pack regular or soft tofu
- 200g pork mince
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 inches ginger, minced
- Spring onion, chopped
- 2 chilis, chopped
- 1 tbsp doubanjiang
- Sauce
	- 1/2 tsp salt
	- 1/2 tsp sugar
	- 2 tbsp light soy sauce
	- 1/4 tsp white pepper of five spice powder
	- 1/4 tsp chicken stock
	- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
	- 1 tbsp corn flour
	- 1/4 cup water

## Method

1) Cube tofu and soak in cold water with a teaspoon of salt
2) Mix the sauce ingredients together
3) Fry pork mince on high heat until no longer pink, then add spring onion, garlic, ginger, and chili and fry until the raw smell is gone
4) Add doubanjiang and stir until the oil is red
5) Add drained tofu and fry until everything is mixed together
6) Add 1 cup of water (should be just below tofu), cover, and cook for 5 minutes
7) Add the sauce and cook until reduced down (if you're happy with the flavour and it's not thick enough then add some corn flour slurry)
