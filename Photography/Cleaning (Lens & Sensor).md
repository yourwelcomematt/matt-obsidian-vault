**Point the lens or camera down, as you don't want dust to settle on it**

## Lens Cleaning

- Always use an air blower to displace and dust or other particles first
- Use a microfibre cloth and lens cleaning solution
- Microfibre cloths with a looser weave are better at absorbing liquids

## Sensor Cleaning

- Always use an air blower to displace and dust or other particles
- Most cameras have a setting to vibrate the sensor in order to clean it
- The Ricoh Pentax Cleaning Kit is really good, as it doesn't require any liquids
