## Identifying dust

- Usually appears as dark spots in your image (like floaters)
- Point your camera at a bright uniform light source such as the sky, and use a narrow aperture such as f16 to more easily identify dust spots
	- Lens dust moves in an out when you zoom with a zoom lens
	- Sensor dust stays in one spot when you zoom with a zoom lens
- Using your phone's torch in a darker room can also help

## General Tips

- Always point the surface you're cleaning downward to prevent dust from settling on it
- Try non-contact cleaning methods first before resorting to contact cleaning methods
- Use an air blower, which is normally strong enough to remove most dust and other particles

## Lens Cleaning

- If air blowing doesn't work, use a brush
- If that doesn't work, use a microfibre cloth and lens cleaning solution
- Microfibre cloths with a looser weave are better at absorbing liquids

## Sensor Cleaning

- Most cameras have a setting to vibrate the sensor in order to clean it - try this first!
- If that doesn't work, use an air blower
- If that doesn't work, use a sensor cleaning swab or the Ricoh Pentax Cleaning Kit
