## What is light metering?

- Light metering is where the camera measures the amount of light in the scene in order to determine the correct exposure
- When shooting in automatic mode or a priority mode, this light meter reading will cause the camera to adjust different exposure settings in order to reach what it thinks is a proper exposure
- When shooting in manual mode, then this light meter reading is just displayed as a reference so you can tell if you are underexposed, overexposed, or correctly exposed
- Most light meters see in black and white, and consider middle grey (halfway between black and white) as the universally correct exposure; however this may not always be the best exposure depending on the situation
- The different light metering modes tell the camera where in the frame to measure the exposure from

## Light metering modes (Fujifilm)

- Spot metering
	- Will measure the light only within a single spot in the scene (need to link the metering spot to the autofocus spot in the settings)
	- Useful for portraits, where the camera would otherwise be tricked into underexposing or overexposing the image when the background is much lighter or darker than the subject, at the expense of the subject
	- Useful when you're shooting from a darker foreground into a brighter background, as it will prevent the camera from overexposing the brighter background in order to achieve a "correct exposure" of the darker foreground
	- Can also be used to achieve a dramatic/high-contrast look in harsh sunlight where the highlights are properly exposed and the shadows fall to black
- Centre-weighted metering
	- Measures light from the entire frame but places the greatest weight on the centre area
	- Not many use cases for this
- Multi metering
	- Measures light based on an analysis of composition, colour, and brightness distribution within the entire frame, providing a balanced overall exposure
	- Recommended in most scenarios
- Average metering
	- Will average out the light within the entire scene and use this as the measurement
	- Can be tricked by heavily backlit or contrasty images, or where shadows or highlights dominate over the other, so may not always be accurate
	- Provides consistent exposure across multiple shots with the same lighting
	- Particularly effective for landscapes and portraits of subjects dressed in black or white

## Auto Exposure Lock (AE-L)

- Locks the exposure, allowing you to recompose and take multiple photos with the same exposure
- Useful whenever there's a bright light source in the scene that you want to expose for (e.g., at night)
- Often mapped to a button which can either be held down or pressed once to lock and once to unlock

## Zone System

- Used to ensure that the camera exposes correctly for different tones (think greyscale)
- When you're in spot metering mode and you try to take a picture of a white object, your camera will underexpose it to achieve what it thinks is the correct exposure (middle grey), even though the resulting image will be different to how we actually see it
- Likewise, if you're trying to take a picture of a black object, your camera will overexpose it to achieve what it thinks is the correct exposure
- To achieve an exposure that matches how we actually see these objects, we can adjust the exposure:
	- For white objects, overexpose by 2 stops
	- For black objects, underexpose by 2 stops
	- For sunset clouds, overexpose by 1 stop
	- For green foliage, underexpose by 1 stop
- The number of stops corresponds with Ansel Adams' zone system, which breaks up light into a series of zones from black to white
	- Middle grey is zone 5
	- Black is zone 3
	- White is zone 7
