 ## What is focal length?
 
- The distance between the optical centre of the lens (where the light converges) and the sensor of the camera
- Determines the camera's field of view (i.e. what it can see) as well as the lens's overall length and size (along with aperture)
- Measured in millimetres (mm)
	- The higher the mm, the narrower the lens's field of view is - i.e. the more zoomed in the lens is
	- The lower the mm, the wider the lens's field of view is - i.e. the more wide angle the lens is
- The industry standard for lens focal lengths is 35mm/full-frame equivalent
	- Smaller sensor sizes result in a more zoomed in image for a given lens focal length compared to a full-frame sensor
	- An APS-C sensor has a 1.5x crop, so we must multiply the lens's focal length by 1.5 to get the full-frame equivalent focal length (e.g. a 50mm lens will be 75mm full-frame equivalent)
	- A Micro Four Thirds sensor has a 2x crop, so we must multiply the lens's focal length by 2 to get the full-frame equivalent focal length (e.g. a 50mm lens will be 100mm full-frame equivalent)

## Lenses by focal length (full-frame equivalent)

### Extreme Wide Angle / Fish Eye

- Focal length range: 18-24mm
- Allow you to capture close-ups and landscapes simultaneously in a single shot
- Extreme wide angle lenses that have distinct distortion are called fish eye lenses, and these exaggerate facial features when used in close proximity

### Wide Angle

- Focal length range: 24-35mm
- Great for capturing wide shots without distortion
- Increases the perceived distance (depth) between the foreground and the background
- Good for landscape and architectural photography

### Standard / Normal

- Focal length range: 35-50mm
- Most similar to how the human eye sees the world
- The ideal choice for a grounded and natural presentation, allowing the viewer to feel more present
- Useful for portraits 

### Telephoto / Long

- Focal length range: 70mm >
- Used to capture distant subjects, making the viewer feel like they are observing the scene from afar
- Compresses the perceived distance (depth) between the foreground and the background and flattens space, achieving the opposite effect than wide angle lenses
- Shakiness becomes more evident, thus requiring image stabilisation or a tripod

### Macro / Micro

- Don't fall within a specific focal length, but rather are defined by their ability to capture extreme close up shots with the sharpest detail
	- Use a macro lens with a longer focal length if you can't get close to the subject
	- Use a macro lens with a shorter focal length if you can get close to the subject and want to include more of the background
- Magnification ratio:
	- 1:1 is the most common, meaning that the size of the image captured is the same size as in real life
	- 5:1 is where the size of the image captured is 5x larger than in real life
- Minimum focusing distance
	- The closest the lens can be to the subject and still be able to focus
	- Macro lenses have a short minimum focusing distance, which also results in a very shallow depth of field, which may be undesirable
	- Increasing this depth of field requires stopping down the aperture, meaning that macro lenses are best used in well-lit environments; this is also because the camera itself can block some of the light, in which case a ring light can help

### Tilt Shift

- While a normal lens gives a consistent plane of focus, a tilt shift lens has a mechanism that allows the plane of focus to be shifted left or right, or tilted up or down, in order to create a blurring effect
- Can be used to create:
	- A miniature effect
	- A dreamy, stylised, and vintage look
