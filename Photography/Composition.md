Composition refers to the placement of subjects within the frame.

## Rule of Thirds

- Split the scene into a 3x3 grid, and place subjects on the left corner of the bottom right square, of the right corner of the bottom left square

## Leading Lines

- Any elements that lead your eye to the subject

## Framing

- Involves framing your subject within other objects in the scene

## Edge Patrol

- Look around the edge of the frame and try to avoid/remove any objects that are randomly poking in and may potentially distract the viewer (e.g., isolated tree branches)
- Preferable to do this in-camera, although you can also use software tools
- If it's taking up a decent amount of the frame then it's probably fine as it's pretty much a part of the shot

## Previewing Compositions

- Close one eye, use your camera screen, or take a photo on your phone to see whether the composition works or not
- Not all compositions that you see with your own eyes will look good in a photo - this is because your eyes see in 3D, whereas a camera sensor sees in 2D
- If it looks good on a screen then it's probably good

## Weight and Balance

- What am I drawn to looking at first?
	- If it's the subject then that's good
	- If it's not the subject then you likely need to recompose
- The greater weight something has, the more it demands your attention
	- Factors that carry differing weights include highlights, shadows, bright colours, details, and negative space
	- Balance can be achieved by "balancing" these different factors in order to produce an aesthetically pleasing shot
	- Bright colours and highlights normally carry the most weight, followed by negative space, details, and shadows
- Is the image top/bottom/left/right heavy? Is it pulling you to one side? Is it balanced?

## Backlighting and Sidelighting

- Think about where the light is in relation to the subject
- Shooting in the same direction as the light source can cause the subject to blend into the background due to flatness
- Having light behind or to the side of the subject creates natural contrast and a more 3D feeling, as light is wrapping around the subject

## Bottom Right (subjective)

- Try to have your subject in the bottom right of the frame, or at the very least on the left or right looking towards the centre
- Don't try to do this at all costs though - if it doesn't work, it doesn't work
- Having the subject looking outwards can also work if you're going for a different vibe

## Visit Locations Again

- Shoot the same compositions over and over again
- This is because the way you look at and shoot compositions will change over time, allowing you to get more out of the same location
- Shooting conditions can also change, and you may have different lenses with you
