- Also known as optical stabilisation (OS) or optical image stabilisation (OIS)
- Counteracts the movement of the camera due to natural human hand shake or other camera movement, resulting in reduced blur (when shooting stills) and shakiness (when shooting video)
- Extremely useful when shooting:
	- Handheld (without a tripod)
	- With longer focal lengths
	- At low shutter speeds
	- At night
- If you're shooting with a tripod, then you should turn IS off, as it can cause weird things to happen as it tries to counteract movement that isn't there

## In-body image stabilisation

- In-body image stabilisation is IS that is build directly into the camera body
- This means that we can use both stabilised and non-stabilised lenses without any worry

### Optical stabilisation

- Achieved by suspending the image sensor within a stabilisation system, and allowing it to maintain a constant position
- Probably the best implementation of IS
- Can cause difficulties with sensor cleaning

### Electronic stabilisation

- Achieved by slightly cropping into the image and using computer processing to stabilise the image
- Can result in weird artifacts and jelly-like distortion

## Lens stabilisation

- Lens stabilisation is IS that is built into the lens, as opposed to within the camera body itself
- Usually not as good as in-body IS
- Can sometimes interfere with in-body IS, however some brands such as Panasonic have technology that allows them to work in conjunction with each other
