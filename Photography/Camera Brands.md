## Canon

### Cameras

- EOS 1500D / Rebel T7
	- Great value
	- Video is very average (no 4K or stabilization)
	- No articulating screen
- 200D
	- Dual pixel auto focus
	- Articulating screen
	- Smallest DSLR that Canon makes
- M50 Mark II
	- Mirrorless
	- Dual pixel auto focus
	- 10 FPS shooting
	- Better at video
	- Articulating touch screen with touch auto focus
	- Eye tracking
	- Less lens options as it doesn’t use the EF mount – the AF-M lens mount has also been pretty much abandoned… [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0HU0Edf5EQ&t=629s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0HU0Edf5EQ&t=629s)
	- 4K video has a massive crop and doesn’t use dual pixel auto focus
	- 305 shot battery life w/ live view so even worse than the Sony’s…
- RP
	- Full frame mirrorless

## Nikon

### Advantages

- Great lenses
- Great ergonomics

### Disadvantages

- Kinda ugly aesthetically
- Not a lot of APS-C lens options for Z mount

### Cameras

- D3500
	- Good at photos and videos
	- Lots of buttons and clunky menus
	- Better performance (i.e. autofocus and snappiness) than the 1500D, although picture quality is pretty much the same
- D5600
	- Step above the D3500 - feels way more high quality in the hand
	- Recommended by Steph
- Z5

## Sony

### Cameras

- A6000 / A6100, A6300 / A6400, and A6500 / A6600
	- All have the same sensor and processor
	- 11 FPS burst mode
	- Higher-end models have a bigger buffer
	- A6300 and above are made of metal with weather sealing, while the A6000 and A6100 are made of plastic with no weather sealing
	- A6500 / A6600:
		- Bigger and heavier due to the deeper and more substantial grip and IS
		- More comfortable to hold due to the bigger grip
		- Use a larger battery, resulting in twice the battery life
	- Not the most ergonomic
	- Short battery life
	- Doesn't come with a battery charger, but can be charged in camera
