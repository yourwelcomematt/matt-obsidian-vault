## What are the challenges of night photography?

- Night photography is often the trickiest subset of photography to master, as you are put in a bit of a sticky situation when it comes to your exposure triangle settings:
	- A higher shutter speed is usually required to reduce motion blur or hand shake, resulting in not enough light entering the camera
	- Your aperture may not open wide enough, or you may not want to open it that wide in order to maintain a deeper depth of field and focus, resulting in not enough light entering the camera
	- A higher ISO can counteract the previous two issues, but may introduce significant grain and noise
- Using a tripod solves most of these issues, as it allows you to use a significantly slower shutter speed while keeping your aperture and ISO at acceptable levels - this is called a long exposure
- You can also use external light sources to help with the lack of light
