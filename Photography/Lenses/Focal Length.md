 ## What is focal length?
 
- The distance between the optical centre of the lens (where the light converges) and the sensor of the camera
- Determines the camera's field of view (i.e. what it can see) as well as the lens's length
- Measured in millimetres (mm)
	- The higher the mm, the narrower the lens's field of view is - i.e. the more zoomed in the lens is
	- The lower the mm, the wider the lens's field of view is - i.e. the more wide angle the lens is
- The industry standard for lens focal lengths is 35mm/full-frame equivalent
	- Smaller sensor sizes result in a more zoomed in image for a given lens focal length compared to a full-frame sensor
	- An APS-C sensor has a 1.5x crop, so we must multiply the lens's focal length by 1.5 to get the full-frame equivalent focal length (e.g. a 50mm lens will be 75mm full-frame equivalent)
	- A Micro Four Thirds sensor has a 2x crop, so we must multiply the lens's focal length by 2 to get the full-frame equivalent focal length (e.g. a 50mm lens will be 100mm full-frame equivalent)
