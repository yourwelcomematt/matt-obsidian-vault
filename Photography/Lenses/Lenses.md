# Focal Length

- The distance between the focal point of the lens (where the light converges) and the sensor of the camera
- Measured in millimetres (mm)
	- The higher the mm, the narrower the lens's field of view is - i.e. the more zoomed in the lens is
	- The lower the mm, the wider the lens's field of view is - i.e. the more wide angle the lens is

## Effect of different sensor sizes on focal length

- The industry standard for lens focal lengths is 35mm/full-frame equivalent
- Smaller sensor sizes result in a more zoomed in image for a given lens focal length compared to a full-frame sensor
	- An APS-C sensor has a 1.5x crop, so we must multiply the lens's focal length by 1.5 to get the full-frame equivalent focal length (e.g. a 50mm lens will be 75mm full-frame equivalent)
	- A Micro Four Thirds sensor has a 2x crop, so we must multiply the lens's focal length by 2 to get the full-frame equivalent focal length (e.g. a 50mm lens will be 100mm full-frame equivalent)

# Aperture

- The size of the hole in the lens where light is able to enter (like the pupil)
- Measured in f-stops (f)
	- The lower the f-stop number, the wider the aperture, resulting in more light being let in and a shallower depth of field (i.e. more background blur behind the subject)
	- The higher the f-stop number, the narrower the aperture, resulting in less light being let in and a deeper depth of field (i.e. less background blur behind the subject)
- The f-stop number on the lens is the lowest f-stop, and thus widest aperture, it can achieve
	- Variable aperture zoom lenses (which are usually cheaper) have different minimum f-stop numbers for different focal lengths (usually higher for longer focal lengths)
	- E.g. for an 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 lens, it can open up to f3.5 at 18mm, but only f5.6 at 55mm
	- This is why prime lenses exist, as they can achieve a lower f-stop number for a given focal length compared to a variable aperture zoom lens
	- More expensive zoom lens have the same minimum f-stop number for all focal lengths
- Lower aperture lenses are generally more expensive

# Prime Lenses

- Have a fixed focal length with no zoom capability
- Advantages
	- Faster
	- Sharper
	- Lower aperture, meaning they are:
		- Better in low light
		- Can achieve a shallower depth of field
- Disadvantages
	- Less versatile

# Zoom Lenses 

- Have a focal length range, allowing them to zoom (e.g. 18-55mm)
- Advantages
	- More versatile
- Disadvantages
	- Slower
	- Less sharp
	- Worse in low light

# Autofocus

- Most lenses are autofocus lenses, which are able to focus on the subject automatically using electronics and motors
- Manual focus lenses require you to manually turn the focus ring on the lens to achieve the focus that you want
	- Usually cheaper
	- Greater control over focus
	- Can focus in conditions where autofocus doesn't work (e.g. in low light)
- Using an autofocus lens on a camera body with an incompatible mount will usually worsen its autofocusing capability, or even turn it into a manual lens

# Mounts

- The mount is the mechanism through which the lens is able to attach to and communicate with the camera body
- In general, a lens built for a specific mount will not work properly when used on another mount
- Different brands have different mounting systems:
	- Sony - E mount
	- Canon - RF mount
	- Nikon - Z mount
	- Fujifilm - XF mount
- Sony, Canon, and Nikon each have different mounting systems for full-frame and cropped sensor cameras

# Image Stabilisation (IS)

- Also known as optical stabilisation (OS), optical image stabilisation (OIS)
- Very handy when shooting at longer focal lengths and in low light
- Some lenses have IS while others do not

# Lens Diameter

- Each lens has a different diameter, thus requiring different a different diameter of lens filter
- Usually marked on the lens
- Instead of buying a lens filter for every lens, a more cost-effective solution is to buy one lens filter for your biggest lens diameter, and then use a step-up ring to adapt the filter to any lens with a diameter less than or equal to your biggest lens

# Filters

- Used to protect lenses from damage and degradation, or give a different look to your photos

# Weather Sealing

- The more expensive, professional-grade lenses are weather sealed, meaning they can be used in all weather conditions (e.g. rain, snow, etc.)

# Starting Out

- Use the kit lens, which is usually an inexpensive zoom lens (e.g. 18-55mm), as:
	- It's more versatile
	- You don't yet know what focal lengths work for your particular situation and style of shooting
