- The mount is the mechanism through which the lens is able to attach to and communicate with the camera body
- In general, a lens built for a specific mount will not work properly when used on another mount
- Different brands have different mounting systems:
	- Sony - E mount
	- Canon - RF mount
	- Nikon - Z mount
	- Fujifilm - XF mount
- Sony, Canon, and Nikon each have different mounting systems for full-frame and cropped sensor cameras
	- A full-frame lens can be used on a cropped sensor camera, however since the image is cropped you won't be taking full advantage of the lens
