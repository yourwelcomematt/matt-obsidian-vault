## What is aperture?

- The aperture refers to both the the hole in the lens where light is able to enter (like the camera's pupil), and the size of the hole
- Measured in f-stops (f)
	- The lower the f-stop number, the wider the aperture, resulting in more light being let in and a shallower depth of field (i.e. more background blur behind the subject and greater separation)
	- The higher the f-stop number, the narrower the aperture, resulting in less light being let in and a deeper depth of field (i.e. less background blur behind the subject and less separation)
	- Each f-stop number either doubles the amount of light let into the camera, or halves it
	- A wider aperture is good for portraits (where we want the subject to be in focus and the background out of focus), a narrower aperture is good for landscapes (where we want both the foreground and background in focus)
- The f-stop number on the lens is the lowest f-stop, and thus widest aperture, it can achieve
	- Variable aperture zoom lenses (which are usually cheaper) have different minimum f-stop numbers for different focal lengths (usually higher for longer focal lengths)
	- E.g. for an 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 lens, it can open up to f3.5 at 18mm, but only f5.6 at 55mm
	- This is why prime lenses exist, as they can achieve a lower f-stop number for a given focal length compared to a variable aperture zoom lens
	- More expensive constant aperture zoom lenses have the same minimum f-stop number for all focal lengths
- Aperture can also affect sharpness:
	- In general, using an f-stop number near the high or low end of a lens's aperture range will result in less sharp images
	- Increasing the f-stop number a bit from the lowest end will usually result in the sharpest images
	- Every lens is sharp at different f-stop numbers
- Lower aperture lenses are generally more expensive and larger
