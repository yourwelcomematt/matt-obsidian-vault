## What is aperture?

- The aperture refers to both the the hole in the lens where light is able to enter (like the camera's pupil), and the size of said hole
- A wider aperture results in more light being let in, and thus a brighter image, while a narrower aperture results in less light being let in, and thus darker image

## F-stop

- Aperture is measured in f-stops (e.g. f2), and this number has an inverse relationship to the size of the aperture
	- The lower the f-stop number, the wider the aperture, while the higher the f-stop number, the narrower the aperture
	- Each f-stop number either doubles the amount of light let into the camera compared to the next number, or halves it
	- Lower f-stop lenses are generally larger and more expensive 
- The f-stop number on the lens is the lowest f-stop, and thus widest aperture, it can achieve
	- Variable aperture zoom lenses (which are usually cheaper) have different minimum f-stop numbers for different focal lengths (usually higher for longer focal lengths)
	- E.g. for an 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 lens, it can open up to f3.5 at 18mm, but only f5.6 at 55mm
	- This is why prime lenses exist, as they can achieve a lower f-stop number for a given focal length compared to a variable aperture zoom lens
	- Constant aperture zoom lenses have the same minimum f-stop number for all focal lengths, however they are more expensive


## Depth of field

- Aperture also has the side effect of controlling the depth of field of an image, which is the amount of background behind the point of focus that is in focus
	- A wider aperture results in a shallower depth of field, allowing us to create images where only the subject is in focus and the background is blurry and out of focus
	- A narrower aperture results in a deeper depth of field, allowing us to create layered images with the foreground, middleground, and background in focus
- This is because when focusing on a subject, the light coming from it will be refracted by the lens into its focal point on the sensor, resulting in it being in focus - in contrast, all other light will have a different focal point, meaning that it will diverge before hitting the sensor or not converge, and result in it being out of focus
	- A wider aperture lets in more diverging light from multiple angles, resulting in a shallower depth of field
	- A narrower aperture lets in less diverging light from fewer angles, resulting in a deeper depth of field
- A wider aperture is good for portraits (where we want the subject to be in focus and the background out of focus), while a narrower aperture is good for landscapes (where we want both the foreground and background in focus)
- A shallower depth of field can also be created by:
	- Moving closer to the subject
	- Having a greater distance between the subject and the background
	- Using a longer focal length

## Effect on sharpness

- In general, using an f-stop number near the high or low end of a lens's aperture range will result in less sharp images
- At the high end, this is due to the effects of diffraction
- Increasing the f-stop number a bit from the lowest end will usually result in the sharpest images
- Different lenses are sharp at different f-stop numbers
