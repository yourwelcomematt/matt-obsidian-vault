## Prime Lenses

- Have a fixed focal length with no zoom capability
- E.g. 50mm
- Advantages
	- Faster
	- Have fewer lens elements, and thus are able to produce sharper images
	- Have larger apertures, meaning they are better in low light and can achieve a shallower depth of field
- Disadvantages
	- Less versatile

## Zoom/Telephoto Lenses 

- Have a focal length range, allowing them to zoom in by adjusting various lens elements 
- E.g. 18-55mm
- Advantages
	- More versatile, as you can shoot a wide range of focal lengths without having to change your lens
	- Saves time, as you don't have to change your lens as often
- Disadvantages
	- Slower
	- Have more lens elements, resulting in them producing less sharp images
	- Have smaller apertures, meaning they are worse in low light
	- The more zoomed in you are, the more shaky it'll be (unless you have IS)
