Different lenses are able to capture the same subject in a completely different way.

## Extreme Wide Angle / Fish Eye

- Focal length range: 18-24mm
- Allow you to capture close-ups and landscapes simultaneously in a single shot
- Extreme wide angle lenses that have distinct distortion are called fish eye lenses
- Fish eye lenses exaggerate facial features when used in close proximity

## Wide Angle

- Focal length range: 24-35mm
- Great for capturing wide shots without distortion
- Can create distance between objects or people when used in tight spaces, allowing it to influence the viewer's perspective
- Results in a stylised look

## Standard / Normal

- Focal length range: 35-50mm
- Most similar to how the human eye sees the world
- The ideal choice for a grounded and natural presentation, allowing the viewer to feel more present

## Telephoto / Long

- Focal length range: 70mm >
- Used to capture distant subjects, making the viewer feel like they are observing the scene from afar
- Compresses distance between the foreground and the background and flattens space, achieving the opposite effect than wide angle lenses - this is useful for isolating a character in a crowd

## Macro / Micro

- Don't fall within a specific focal length, but rather are defined by their ability to capture extreme close up shots with the sharpest detail
	- Use a macro lens with a longer focal length if you can't get close to the subject
	- Use a macro lens with a shorter focal length if you can get close to the subject and want to include more of the background
- Magnification ratio:
	- 1:1 is the most common, meaning that the size of the image captured is the same size as in real life
	- 5:1 is where the size of the image captured is 5x larger than in real life
- Minimum focusing distance
	- The closest the lens can be to the subject and still be able to focus

## Tilt Shift

- While a normal lens gives a consistent plane of focus, a tilt shift lens has a mechanism that allows the plane of focus to be shifted left or right, or tilted up or down, in order to create a blurring effect
- Can be used to create:
	- A miniature effect
	- A dreamy, stylised, and vintage look
