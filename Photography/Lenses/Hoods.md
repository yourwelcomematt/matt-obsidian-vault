## What is a lens hood?

- A lens hood is a plastic cone that attaches to the front of a lens
- Shades the front of the lens, preventing unwanted stray light from causing lens flares or producing a washed-out look
- Can increase contrast and saturation
- Helps protect your lens from getting damaged by providing physical protection

## When should I not use a lens hood?

- When you want lens flares for artistic effect
- To reduce size and avoid attention
- When using the flash, as the lens hood can cast a shadow on the subject

## Lens hood types

- Flower/pedal hoods
	- Commonly found on wide angle lenses
	- Strike a balance between shading the lens and not appearing in the shot
- Cone hoods
	- Commonly found on long-range zoom lenses
	- Don't need the cut-outs of flower hoods, as they are never wide enough to be at risk of appearing in the shot
