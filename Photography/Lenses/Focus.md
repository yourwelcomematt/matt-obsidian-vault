## Autofocus

- Most lenses are autofocus (AF) lenses, which are able to focus on the subject automatically using electronics and motors
	- Different lenses have different kinds of motors, resulting in varying levels of sound when focusing - this can be annoying when shooting video, as the motor sound may be loud enough to show up in the video
- Manual focus (MF) lenses require you to manually turn the focus ring on the lens to achieve the focus that you want
	- Usually cheaper
	- Greater control
	- Can focus in conditions where autofocus struggles (e.g. in low light or if the subject lacks contrast)
- Most cameras with autofocus lenses give you the ability to switch between autofocus and manual focus, either via a physical switch or in the camera's menus
- Using an autofocus lens on a camera body with an incompatible mount will usually worsen its autofocusing capability, or even turn it into a manual lens

## Minimum Focusing Distance

- The closest the lens can be to a subject and still be able to focus
- Usually marked on the side of the lens, along with the word "macro" or a flower symbol
- In general, the shorter the focusing distance, the greater the background blur (bokeh)
