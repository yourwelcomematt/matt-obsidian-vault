1) Light enters the lens through the aperture
2) Light passes through different glass shades called lens elements, which slightly bend (refract) the light inwards
3) Light lands on a focal point on the camera's image sensor
4) The image sensor records the light data and the image is taken

## Focal Length

- The distance between the optical centre of the lens (where the light converges) and the sensor of the camera
- Determines the camera's field of view (i.e. what it can see) as well as the lens's length
- Measured in millimetres (mm)
	- The higher the mm, the narrower the lens's field of view is - i.e. the more zoomed in the lens is
	- The lower the mm, the wider the lens's field of view is - i.e. the more wide angle the lens is
- The industry standard for lens focal lengths is 35mm/full-frame equivalent
	- Smaller sensor sizes result in a more zoomed in image for a given lens focal length compared to a full-frame sensor
	- An APS-C sensor has a 1.5x crop, so we must multiply the lens's focal length by 1.5 to get the full-frame equivalent focal length (e.g. a 50mm lens will be 75mm full-frame equivalent)
	- A Micro Four Thirds sensor has a 2x crop, so we must multiply the lens's focal length by 2 to get the full-frame equivalent focal length (e.g. a 50mm lens will be 100mm full-frame equivalent)

## Aperture

- The size of the hole in the lens where light is able to enter (like the pupil)
- Measured in f-stops (f)
	- The lower the f-stop number, the wider the aperture, resulting in more light being let in and a shallower depth of field (i.e. more background blur behind the subject and greater separation)
	- The higher the f-stop number, the narrower the aperture, resulting in less light being let in and a deeper depth of field (i.e. less background blur behind the subject and less separation)
	- The former is good for portraits (where we want the subject to be in focus and the background out of focus), while the latter is good for landscapes (where we want both the foreground and background in focus)
	- Each f-stop either increases the amount of light let into the camera by 2x, or decreases it by 1/2x
- The f-stop number on the lens is the lowest f-stop, and thus widest aperture, it can achieve
	- Variable aperture zoom lenses (which are usually cheaper) have different minimum f-stop numbers for different focal lengths (usually higher for longer focal lengths)
	- E.g. for an 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 lens, it can open up to f3.5 at 18mm, but only f5.6 at 55mm
	- This is why prime lenses exist, as they can achieve a lower f-stop number for a given focal length compared to a variable aperture zoom lens
	- More expensive constant aperture zoom lenses have the same minimum f-stop number for all focal lengths
- Lower aperture lenses are generally more expensive
