## What is the depth of field?

The depth of field is the amount of background behind the point of focus that is in focus.

Deep focus
- Everything is in focus
- Allows you to create layered images with things in the foreground, middleground, and background

Shallow focus
* Only the subject is in focus, with the rest of the image being soft
* Draws attention to the subject

Soft focus
* No part of the image is 100% sharp
* Achieved via lens imperfections or diffusion filters
* Results in a dreamy or hazy atmosphere


## Bokeh

- Bokeh is the natural background blur that you get when focusing on a foreground subject, which is a result of a shallow depth of field
- The smaller the aperture, the shallower the depth of field and the greater the bokeh
- The greater the focal length, the greater the bokeh (to a lesser extent than aperture)
- As such, the lens that will give you the most bokeh will be a high focal length, low aperture lens

### Full-Frame vs APS-C bokeh

- There is a commonly-held belief that full-frame cameras give you greater bokeh than APS-C cameras, however this is not technically true:
	- At the same distance from the subject and with the same lens, focal length, and aperture, the images from a full-frame camera and a APS-C camera will have the same amount of bokeh, however the APS-C image will be cropped in by 1.5x, resulting in a narrower field of view
	- To achieve the same field of view and therefore the same image, you would need to move the full-frame camera closer to the subject
	- As a result, the full-frame camera will have a shorter focusing distance to the subject, which results in greater bokeh
	- We can achieve the same level of bokeh in the APS-C camera by dividing its f-stop value by the crop factor, which is 1.5x, and then setting its aperture to the resulting value (e.g. f2.8 in a full-frame camera is roughly equal to f1.8 in an APS-C camera)
