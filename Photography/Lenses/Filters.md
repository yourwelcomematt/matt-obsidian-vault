## Lens Diameter

- Each lens has a different diameter, thus requiring different a different diameter of lens filter
- Usually marked on the lens
- Instead of buying a lens filter for every lens, a more cost-effective and practical solution is to buy one lens filter for your biggest lens diameter, and then use a step-up ring to adapt the filter to any lens with a diameter less than or equal to your biggest lens
- Alternatively, you can use another adaptive filter solution
