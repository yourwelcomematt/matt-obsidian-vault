## What is the shutter?

- The shutter in a camera is a mechanical component that covers the image sensor and determines whether light can hit it or not

## Mechanical shutters

### Focal plane shutters

- Most SLRs use focal-plane shutters, which are situated directly in front of the image sensor (focal plane)
- Focal-plane shutters consist of two shutter curtains - a front curtain and a rear curtain
- At lower shutter speeds, the front curtain will move out of the way of the sensor entirely before the rear curtain moves to cover it, enabling more light to hit the sensor
- At higher shutter speeds, the rear curtain starts closing before the front curtain has fully opened - this results in a horizontal slit that travels vertically across the sensor, and less light hitting the sensor
- Faster shutter speeds simply require a narrower slit, as the speed of travel of the shutter curtains is not normally varied
- The downside to this is that you cannot use a flash at faster shutter speeds, as only a small part of the sensor will be lit

#### DSLR implementation

- At rest, the front curtain is covering the image sensor, as the image sensor is not needed to produce a viewfinder or live view image
- When the shutter button is pressed, the front curtain opens and exposes the image sensor to light for a specified amount of time, before the rear curtain closes and ends the exposure

#### Mirrorless implementation

- At rest, the front curtain is retracted, exposing the image sensor to light and allowing it to produce an image for both the electronic viewfinder and the live view image on the LCD screen
- When the shutter button is pressed, the front curtain first comes down to cover the image sensor, and then retracts to expose the image sensor to light for a specified amount of time, before the rear curtain closes to end the exposure and then retracts to expose the sensor for the EVF and live view
- This is why you will usually hear the shutter sound twice when shooting, as both the front and rear curtains make a sound
- Some cameras have an electronic front curtain option, where instead of using the mechanical front curtain, the exposure is started electronically by the sensor and ended by closing the rear curtain - in this case, only one sound will be heard

### Leaf shutters

- Situated up against the rear of the lens, further forward from the sensor
- Work similar to the camera's aperture, in that they consist of overlapping metal blades
- At rest, these blades are closed to prevent light from hitting the sensor
- When the shutter button is pressed, the blades open to allow light to hit the sensor, and then close again to end the exposure
- Main advantage is that it does not have to cover the whole image sensor size-wise, and can be as small as the rear element of the lens

## Electronic shutters

- With an electronic shutter, the sensor is exposed the entire time, and no mechanical moving parts are used to expose the sensor; instead, the sensor acts as the shutter
- When the shutter button is pressed, the sensor starts to record light data for a specified amount of time, and then stops recording it
- Most modern cameras give you the option of using the mechanical shutter or the electronic shutter

### Rolling vs global shutter

- In an electronic shutter, light data is recorded using one of two methods: rolling shutter or global shutter
- A rolling shutter doesn't take the whole image at the same time - it is normally taken from top to bottom, row by row of the sensor
	- Found in all cameras with CMOS sensors
	- Can result in images where the bottom part of a fast-moving subject is further ahead of the top part 
- A global shutter takes the whole image at the same time (i.e. the sensor switches completely on and off)

### Mechanical vs electronic

- Shutter speed
	- Electronic shutters can achieve faster shutter speeds
- Rolling shutter
	- Electronic shutters are far more susceptible to rolling shutter, where fast-moving subjects are distorted
- Life span
	- Mechanical shutters have a shorter life span due to their mechanical parts
- EVF
	- Mechanical shutters are better in situations with flickering lights
	- The EVF does not blackout with electronic shutters when taking a photo
- Shutter shock
	- Mechanical shutters can cause the camera to vibrate
- Response time
	- Mechanical shutters have a slower response time (i.e. after pressing the shutter)
- Shutter sound
	- Electronic shutters are completely silent
- FPS
	- Electronic shutters can achieve a higher FPS due to the lack of mechanical parts
- Flash sync speed
	- Mechanical shutters allow you to use a flash at faster shutter speeds
- Video
	- Electronic shutters enable video shooting


## What is shutter speed?

- The amount of time that the shutter is retracted for is called the shutter speed, and this determines how long the sensor is exposed to light (i.e. the exposure time)
- Shutter speed is expressed in seconds (e.g. 3) or fractions of a second (e.g. 1/30), the former being slower and the latter being faster 
- Your choice of shutter speed will depend on how much light you need and what you're shooting
- Fast shutter speed
	- Freezes fast action
	- Lets in less light, resulting in darker images
	- Better for fast-moving subjects (e.g. children, animals, sports, cars)
- Slow shutter speed
	- Captures motion blur
	- Lets in more light, resulting in brighter images
	- Better for still or slow-moving subjects (e.g. landscapes)
- 1/50 or 1/60 is a good baseline shutter speed, but it really depends on your lens's focal length
	- The longer the lens is, the more difficult it is to keep it steady
	- As such, a longer lens requires a faster shutter speed to ensure that images don't come out blurry
	- A good rule of thumb is to not go lower than 1 / focal length - 1 / 2 x focal length is pretty safe
	- When filming video, you should use a shutter speed that is twice the number of frames per second you're filming in, as this produces natural-looking motion blur


## What is shutter count?

- The shutter count of a camera is the number of times that the mechanical shutter has been released
- Most manufacturers give their cameras a shutter count lifespan rating, after which it may not work reliably
- Often used to estimate how much a camera has been used
- Using the electronic shutter does not increase the shutter count
