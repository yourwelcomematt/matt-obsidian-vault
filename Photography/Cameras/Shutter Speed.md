## What is the shutter?

- The shutter in a camera is a metal curtain that covers the image sensor and determines whether light can hit it or not
- By default, the shutter is retracted and the image sensor is exposed to light in a mirrorless camera, or is covered by the viewfinder mirror in a DSLR
- When the shutter button is pressed, the shutter passes over the image sensor for a specified amount of time, allowing a certain amount of light to hit the image sensor and register an exposure, before returning to its original position


## What is shutter speed?

- The amount of time that the shutter passes over the sensor for is called the shutter speed, and this determines how much light the sensor is exposed to
- Shutter speed is expressed in seconds (e.g. 3) or fractions of a second (e.g. 1/30), the former being slower and the latter being faster 
- Your choice of shutter speed will depend on how much light you need and what you're shooting
- Fast shutter speed
	- Freezes fast action
	- Lets in less light, resulting in darker images
	- Better for fast-moving subjects (e.g. children, animals, sports, cars)
- Slow shutter speed
	- Captures motion blur
	- Lets in more light, resulting in brighter images
	- Better for still or slow-moving subjects (e.g. landscapes)
- 1/50 or 1/60 is a good baseline shutter speed, but it really depends on your lens's focal length
	- The longer the lens is, the more difficult it is to keep it steady
	- As such, a longer lens requires a faster shutter speed to ensure that images don't come out blurry
	- A good rule of thumb is to not go lower than 1 / focal length - 1 / 2 x focal length is pretty safe
	- When filming video, you should use a shutter speed that is twice the number of frames per second you're filming in
