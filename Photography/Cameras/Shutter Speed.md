## What is the shutter?

- The shutter in a camera is a mechanical component that covers the image sensor and determines whether light can hit it or not
- Most SLRs use focal-plane shutters, which are situated directly in front of the image sensor
	- Focal-plane shutters consist of two shutter curtains - a front curtain and a rear curtain
	- At lower shutter speeds, the first curtain will move out of the way of the sensor entirely before the second curtain moves to cover it, enabling more light to hit the sensor
	- At higher shutter speeds, the distance between the first and second curtains decreases, meaning that as the first curtain moves out of the way of the sensor, it is closely followed by the second curtain, resulting in less light hitting the sensor

## Mechanical shutters

### DSLR shutters

- At rest, the shutter is covering the image sensor, as the image sensor is not needed to produce a viewfinder or live view image
- When the shutter button is pressed, the shutter retracts and exposes the image sensor to light for a specified amount of time, before returning to its original position and ending the exposure

### Mirrorless shutters

- At rest, the shutter is retracted, exposing the image sensor to light and allowing it to produce an image for both the electronic viewfinder and the live view image
- When the shutter button is pressed, the shutter first comes down to cover the image sensor, then retracts to expose the image sensor to light for a specified amount of time, then comes down to cover the image sensor again to end the exposure, and then returns to its original position

## Electronic shutters

- With an electronic shutter, the sensor is exposed the entire time and no mechanical moving parts are used
- When the shutter button is pressed, the sensor starts to record light data for a specified amount of time, and then stops recording it
- Most modern cameras give you the option of using the mechanical shutter or the electronic shutter
- Enables video shooting, silent shooting and faster FPS

## Rolling vs global shutter technology

- A mechanical or electronic rolling shutter doesn't take the whole image at the same time - it is normally taken from top to bottom
	- Found in all cameras with CMOS sensors
	- Can result in images where the bottom part of a fast-moving subject is further ahead of the top part
- A global shutter takes the whole image at the same time

## What is shutter speed?

- The amount of time that the shutter is retracted for is called the shutter speed, and this determines how long the sensor is exposed to light (i.e. the exposure time)
- Shutter speed is expressed in seconds (e.g. 3) or fractions of a second (e.g. 1/30), the former being slower and the latter being faster 
- Your choice of shutter speed will depend on how much light you need and what you're shooting
- Fast shutter speed
	- Freezes fast action
	- Lets in less light, resulting in darker images
	- Better for fast-moving subjects (e.g. children, animals, sports, cars)
- Slow shutter speed
	- Captures motion blur
	- Lets in more light, resulting in brighter images
	- Better for still or slow-moving subjects (e.g. landscapes)
- 1/50 or 1/60 is a good baseline shutter speed, but it really depends on your lens's focal length
	- The longer the lens is, the more difficult it is to keep it steady
	- As such, a longer lens requires a faster shutter speed to ensure that images don't come out blurry
	- A good rule of thumb is to not go lower than 1 / focal length - 1 / 2 x focal length is pretty safe
	- When filming video, you should use a shutter speed that is twice the number of frames per second you're filming in, as this produces natural-looking motion blur
