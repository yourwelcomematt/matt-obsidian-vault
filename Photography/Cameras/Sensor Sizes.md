## What is sensor size?

## Full-Frame

- Same size as 35mm film, which is considered the standard
- The most expensive 
- Wider field of view than other sensor sizes
- Bigger pixels, resulting in:
	- Greater detail and dynamic range
	- Better low-light performance
	- Less noise
- Commonly believed to be able to achieve greater bokeh than smaller sensor sizes, however this is [[Depth of Field & Bokeh|technically not the case]].

## APS-C

- 1.5x smaller than a full-frame sensor, resulting in a 1.5x crop to the resulting image
- Results in a smaller form factor camera than a full-frame camera
- Can achieve the same level of brightness in low light as a full-frame sensor at a given f-stop value, however the noise will be greater
	- To counter this, we would need to reduce the f-stop value by a whole stop in order for us to be able to reduce the ISO and subsequently the noise in the image
- Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm, Sony

## Micro Four Thirds

- 2x smaller than a full-frame sensor, resulting in a 2x crop to the resulting image
- Lenses for Micro Four Thirds cameras usually come in much lower focal lengths due to the 2x crop
- Panasonic and Olympus
