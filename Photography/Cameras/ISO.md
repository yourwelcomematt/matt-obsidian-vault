## What is ISO?

- ISO is the light sensitivity of the image sensor in the camera, which is a result of the amount of voltage/current running through it
	- Essentially sensor gain, as the image is being digitally boosted
	- Hugely valuable as you will often be using a particular aperture to achieve a certain look, and a particular shutter speed to reduce blurriness or shake, and will thus be reliant on ISO to achieve a correct exposure
- A lower ISO number indicates lower sensitivity to light and thus darker images
- A higher ISO number indicates higher sensitivity to light and thus brighter images
- The downside of using a higher ISO is that it introduces more grain and digital noise (signal interference) into images, which is often undesired
	- This is because a sensor with high light sensitivity will start to pick up everything around it and generate heat
	- Like a volume knob, where high volumes result in feedback and distortion
- Different cameras have different levels of ISO performance (i.e. different ranges between which they look their best) - this is called the base or native ISO
	- Sony cameras can generally be used at higher ISO numbers than other cameras while still retaining good image quality, which is especially useful in low-light settings
	- The base ISO for photography and video within a single camera is often different
- You should use the lowest ISO possible to achieve the exposure you want
- Shooting at a high ISO makes it difficult to recover a JPEG image in post if it is underexposed, as boosting the shadows or brightness will just result in lots of grain. If you're shooting at a high ISO, try to make sure that the image is properly exposed at the time.
