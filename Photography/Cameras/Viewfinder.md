# Diopter

- A diopter is an optical tool which adjusts the camera's viewfinder to suit your eyes, allowing you to see a clear and focused image without needing glasses
- In most modern cameras, the diopter wheel is located right next to the viewfinder
- Should be used if you find the viewfinder is blurry - in particular the symbology (i.e. ISO, shutter speed, grid, etc.)
