## What is white balance?

- The white balance of an image is a measure of how warm or cool the colours/light in the image are
- Measured in Kelvin (K), with higher Kelvin values being warmer (more red) and lower Kelvin values being cooler (more blue)
- In order to get accurate colours to what we are seeing in real life, we should ensure that we are using the correct white balance
- Most cameras have an auto WB setting, which works pretty well in most conditions, and also allow you to dial in a custom Kelvin or choose a preset (e.g., shade, cloudy, fluorescent, incandescent)
- You can determine the exact white balance required for a scene by using a grey card
