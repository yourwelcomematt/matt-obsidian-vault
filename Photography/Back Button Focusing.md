## What is back button focusing?

- Back button focusing is a focusing technique that involves decoupling the act of focusing from the shutter button
- Traditionally, half-pressing the shutter button causes the camera to focus, with a full press capturing the image
- The downside to this is that if you want to take multiple shots of a certain focus point, then the camera will refocus every time you press the shutter
- Back button focusing allows you to only have to focus once before firing multiple shots

## Enabling back button focusing

1) Disable autofocusing with the shutter
2) Assign autofocusing to a button on the back of the camera (e.g., AF-L)
3) Switch to AF-C (or manual mode for a Fujifilm camera)
4) You can now press the dedicated autofocus button once to emulate AF-S, or hold it to use AF-C, giving you the best of both worlds without having to change between the different modes
5) If you want, you can still keep shutter autofocus enabled for AF-S, as this makes it easier when handing your camera over to someone who isn't as experienced
