## What is back button focusing?

- Traditionally, half-pressing the shutter button causes the camera to focus, with a full press capturing the image
- The downsides to this are:
	- If you want to take multiple shots of a given focus point, then the camera will refocus every time you press the shutter, which wastes time and can cause the focus to change
	- If you want to use the focus and recompose technique, then you can't take multiple shots of a given composition without having to focus and recompose every time, as the camera will attempt to refocus every time you press the shutter button
- Back button focusing is technique that involves decoupling the act of focusing from the shutter button and assigning it to a separate dedicated button
- The advantages to this are:
	- It prevents the camera from trying to focus every time the shutter button is pressed, allowing you to only have to focus once with the dedicated focus button before firing multiple shots with the shutter button
	- It allows you to focus, recompose, and take multiple shots without having to refocus
	- It allows you to stay in AF-C the whole time instead of switching between AF-S and AF-C
	- It makes the camera easier to operate when wearing gloves
- Metering or AE-L is still assigned to the shutter button

## Enabling back button focusing

1) Disable autofocusing with the shutter in AF-C
2) Assign autofocusing to a button on the back of the camera (e.g., AF-L)
3) Switch to AF-C (or manual mode for a Fujifilm camera)
4) You can now press the dedicated autofocus button once to emulate AF-S, or hold it to use AF-C, giving you the best of both worlds without having to change between the different modes
5) If you want, you can still keep shutter autofocus enabled for AF-S, as this makes it easier when handing your camera over to someone who isn't as experienced
