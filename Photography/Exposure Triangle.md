## What is the exposure triangle?

- The exposure triangle refers to the three camera settings that primarily influence the exposure of an image (i.e. how dark or bright the image is), and that must be balanced to achieve a correct exposure and/or particular artistic effect
- These settings are:
	- Aperture
	- Shutter speed
	- ISO
- Adjusting any of these settings can darken or brighten an image, however they each have their own side effects that affect the resulting image and must be taken into consideration
- Ideally, aperture and/or shutter speed should be modified first, with ISO only being modified if you have to - this is because higher ISOs introduce unwanted noise which can affect image quality


## Aperture

- Wider aperture = more light, shallower depth of field, more bokeh
- Smaller aperture = less light, deeper depth of field, less bokeh
- For more info, refer to [[Focal Length|this]] page


## Shutter speed

- Higher shutter speed = less light, frozen action
- Lower shutter speed = more light, motion blur
- For more info, refer to [[Shutter Speed|this]] page


## ISO 

- The only setting that doesn't control how much light is let into the camera
- Higher ISO = brighter image, more noise/grain
- Lower ISO = darker image, less noise/grain
- For more info, refer to [[ISO|this]] page
