## What is the exposure triangle?

- The exposure triangle refers to the three camera settings that primarily influence the exposure of an image (i.e. how dark or bright the image is), and that must be balanced to achieve a correct exposure and/or particular artistic effect
- These settings are:
	- Aperture
	- Shutter speed
	- ISO
- Adjusting any of these settings can darken or brighten an image, however they each have their own side effects that affect the resulting image and must be taken into consideration


## Aperture

- Wider aperture = shallower depth of field and more bokeh
- Smaller aperture = deeper depth of field and less bokeh
- For more info, refer to [[Focal Length|this]] page


## Shutter speed

- Higher shutter speed = frozen action
- Lower shutter speed = motion blur
- For more info, refer to [[Shutter Speed|this]] page


## ISO 

- Higher ISO = more noise/grain
- Lower ISO = less noise/grain
- For more info, refer to [[ISO|this]] page
