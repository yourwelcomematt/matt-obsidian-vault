## What are anamorphic lenses?

- Most lenses are spherical lenses, meaning they only contain spherical lens elements and do not distort the image coming through them
- Back in the day, filmmakers wanted to achieve a wider aspect ratio / field of view, however they were limited by the 3x2 aspect ratio of 35mm film stocks of the time
- While they could just chop off top and bottom of the frame, this was not ideal as it resulted in a loss of resolution and brightness
- The solution to this problem were anamorphic lenses, which contain additional oval glass elements that squeeze the image coming through them horizontally, allowing it to fit onto the 35mm film stocks they were already using
- When the movie was played, the projector would then desqueeze the image to produce a wide aspect ratio image
- Anamorphic lenses proved to be extremely popular for many years, and while modern cameras are now able to achieve wide aspect ratios using spherical lenses, many of the side effects of the squeezing and desqueezing process came to be regarded as highly cinematic and desirable

## Qualities of anamorphic lenses

- Oval-shaped bokeh
- Horizontal lens flares, which can be different colours
- Outward distortion of vertical lines as you move further out from the centre of the image
- Fall-off of sharpness from the centre of the frame, resulting in a softer feel
- Perceived shallower depth of field due to stronger background blur and disproportionate magnification of objects closer to the lens
- More organic focus roll-off (i.e., the transition between in-focus and out-of-focus objects), integrating the subject more naturally with the background
- Varied representations of focus breathing
- Less "clean" feel than spherical lenses

## Squeeze factor

- The squeeze factor is a measure of how much an anamorphic lens squeezes the incoming image
- The higher the squeeze factor, the more pronounced the aforementioned anamorphic qualities/look become
- The most common squeeze factor is 2x, although 1.33x is also popular
