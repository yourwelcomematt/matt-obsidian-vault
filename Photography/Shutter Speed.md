## What is the shutter?

- The shutter in a camera is a mechanical component that covers the image sensor and determines whether light can hit it or not
- When the shutter is retracted, then light can hit the sensor and it can record an image
- When the shutter is covering the sensor, then light cannot hit it and it cannot record an image
- Shutters come in both mechanical and electronic forms

## Mechanical shutters

### Focal plane shutters

- Most SLRs use focal-plane shutters, which are situated directly in front of the image sensor (focal plane)
- Focal-plane shutters consist of two shutter curtains - a front curtain and a rear curtain
- At lower shutter speeds, the front curtain will move out of the way of the sensor entirely before the rear curtain moves to cover it, enabling more light to hit the sensor
- At higher shutter speeds, the rear curtain starts closing before the front curtain has fully opened - this results in a horizontal slit that travels vertically across the sensor, and less light hitting the sensor
- Faster shutter speeds simply require a narrower slit, as the speed of travel of the shutter curtains is not normally varied
- The downside to this is that you cannot use a flash at faster shutter speeds, as only a small section of the sensor will be lit when the flash is fired, resulting in black banding within the image
- The maximum shutter speed that a flash can be used with is called the flash sync speed, and is marked with an x in Fujifilm cameras

#### DSLR implementation

- At rest, the front curtain is covering the image sensor, as the image sensor is not needed to produce a viewfinder or live view image
- When the shutter button is pressed, the front curtain opens and exposes the image sensor to light for a specified amount of time, before the rear curtain closes and ends the exposure

#### Mirrorless implementation

- At rest, the front curtain is retracted, exposing the image sensor to light and allowing it to produce an image for both the electronic viewfinder and the live view image on the LCD screen
- When the shutter button is pressed, the front curtain first comes down to cover the image sensor, and then retracts to expose the image sensor to light for a specified amount of time, before the rear curtain closes to end the exposure and then retracts to expose the sensor for the EVF and live view
- This is why you will usually hear the shutter sound twice when shooting, as both the front and rear curtains make a sound
- Some cameras have an electronic front curtain option, where instead of using the mechanical front curtain, the exposure is started electronically by the sensor and ended by closing the rear curtain - in this case, only one sound will be heard

### Leaf shutters

- Situated up against the rear of the lens, further forward from the sensor
- Work similar to the camera's aperture, in that they consist of overlapping metal blades
- At rest, these blades are closed to prevent light from hitting the sensor
- When the shutter button is pressed, the blades open to allow light to hit the sensor, and then close again to end the exposure
- Main advantage is that it does not have to cover the whole image sensor size-wise, and can be as small as the rear element of the lens

## Electronic shutters

- With an electronic shutter, the sensor is exposed the entire time, and no mechanical moving parts are used to expose the sensor; instead, the sensor acts as the shutter
- When the shutter button is pressed, the sensor starts to record light data for a specified amount of time, and then stops recording it
- Most modern cameras give you the option of using the mechanical shutter or the electronic shutter, or a combination of both
- All smartphone cameras use an electronic shutter

### Rolling vs global shutter

- In an electronic shutter, light data is recorded using one of two methods: rolling shutter or global shutter
- A rolling shutter doesn't take the whole image at the same time - it is normally taken from top to bottom, row by row of the sensor
	- Found in all cameras with CMOS sensors
	- Can result in images where the bottom part of a fast-moving subject is further ahead of the top part, as they were taken at different times
- A global shutter takes the whole image at the same time (i.e. the sensor switches completely on and off), however this is not very common in consumer cameras
	- Downsides are that they often have a lower dynamic range and don't work as well in low-light situations

## Mechanical vs electronic shutters

- Shutter speed
	- Electronic shutters can achieve faster shutter speeds
- Rolling shutter
	- Electronic shutters are far more susceptible to rolling shutter, where fast-moving subjects are distorted
	- This is because a mechanical shutter gives the sensor pixels extra time to record light information
- Life span
	- Mechanical shutters have a shorter life span due to their mechanical parts
- EVF
	- Mechanical shutters are better in situations with flickering lights
	- The EVF does not blackout with electronic shutters when taking a photo
- Shutter shock
	- Mechanical shutters can cause the camera to vibrate, potentially affecting the final image
- Response time
	- Mechanical shutters have a slower response time (i.e. how much time it takes after pressing the shutter button for the shutter to activate)
- Shutter sound
	- Electronic shutters are completely silent
- FPS
	- Electronic shutters can achieve a higher FPS due to the lack of mechanical parts
- Flash sync speed
	- Mechanical shutters allow you to use a flash at faster shutter speeds
- Video
	- Electronic shutters enable video shooting
- Battery life
	- Mechanical shutters use up less battery than electronic shutters


## What is shutter speed?

- The amount of time that the shutter is retracted for is called the shutter speed, and this determines how long the sensor is exposed to light (i.e. the exposure time)
- Shutter speed is expressed in seconds (e.g. 3) or fractions of a second (e.g. 1/30), the former being slower and the latter being faster 
- A faster shutter speed lets in less light, while a slower shutter speed lets in more light

### Motion blur

- The main side effect of shutter speed is motion blur - a faster shutter speed reduces motion blur and freezes moving subjects, while a slower shutter speed increases motion blur
- As such, a faster shutter speed is better for fast-moving subjects (e.g. children, animals, sports, cars) or when the camera is likely to move, while a slower shutter speed is better for still/slow-moving subjects (e.g. landscapes), long exposures (e.g., light trails, smoothing of clouds or water), or when the camera is unlikely to move
- 1/50 or 1/60 is a good baseline shutter speed, but it really depends on your lens's focal length
	- The longer the lens is, the more difficult it is to keep it steady
	- As such, a longer lens requires a faster shutter speed to ensure that images don't come out blurry
	- A good rule of thumb is to not go lower than 1 / focal length - 1 / 2 x the focal length is pretty safe
	- When filming video, you should use a shutter speed that is twice the number of frames per second you're filming in, as this produces natural-looking motion blur

## What is shutter angle?

- Shutter angle measures the same thing as shutter speed (how long the sensor or film is exposed to light), but just in degrees instead of time
- The measurement of choice for filmmaking, as it has its roots in old cinema film cameras that used a rotary shutter
	- The rotary shutter was a disc that covered the film and prevented light from hitting it (just like how a modern shutter covers the sensor), except for a configurable angled gap that would let light pass through
	- When the camera was running, this disc would rotate in sync with the film, completing one rotation for each frame of film
	- For each rotation, light was able to pass through the gap and expose the frame of film for an amount of time corresponding to the size of the gap
	- This gap took up a certain number of degrees of the disc, with the most common being 180 degrees, which meant that the disc was a semicircle and would expose each frame to light for half of a rotation
	- Larger shutter angles (e.g., 360 degrees) exposed the frame to more light, while smaller shutter angles (e.g., 90 degrees) exposed the frame to less light
	- A shutter angle of 180 degrees produces motion blur that is considered to be most natural to the human eye
	- To achieve the same look with a camera that uses shutter speed instead of shutter angle, we should use a shutter speed that is twice the FPS - in other words, 1/48 of a second
	- This is because at the default cinema frame rate 24 FPS, each frame lasts for 1/24 of a second, and with a 180 degree shutter, each frame is only exposed to light for half a rotation - half of 1/24 of a second gives us a 1/48 of a second exposure time for each frame, and 48 is 2 x 24, giving rise to the aforementioned rule
- The benefit of using shutter angle over shutter speed for video is that it removes the need to calculate and adjust the shutter speed whenever the frame rate changes, as the camera will automatically adjust the shutter speed to maintain the desired shutter angle

## What is shutter count?

- The shutter count of a camera is the number of times that the mechanical shutter has been released
- Most manufacturers give their cameras a shutter count lifespan rating, after which it may not work reliably
- Often used to estimate how much a camera has been used
- Using the electronic shutter does not increase the shutter count
