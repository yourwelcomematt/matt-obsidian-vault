Quick tip for the peeps out there: if you use glass storage bottles it takes longer to get up to temperature, but then they maintain the temperature better. Plastic bottles are the opposite. Neither is better than the other, just personal preference

Quick tip that I learned that wasn't talked about in the video but can save your future rolls - use your finger to hold the rotating cover when pouring the chemicals out. It can become loose very easily during agitation and can open up when pouring your chemicals out and expose your film before it's fixed! I learned the hard way

After every inversion cycle: tap your tank on the counter to prevent bubbles sticking on your film. I can tell from experience that its really shitty when you have bubble marks on your photos.
