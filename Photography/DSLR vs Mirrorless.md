## DSLR

- Uses an internal mirror prism system to create the viewfinder image
- Pros
	- Cheaper
	- Longer battery life, as the sensor is not active the whole time
	- Wider lens selection, as they've been around for longer
	- More tanky and robust
	- Better for shooting in situations with flashing lights, fast-moving action, or flickering, as there is no lag in the viewfinder; it is exactly what you would see in real life
- Cons
	- Older technology, with many brands discontinuing support for them
	- Bigger and bulkier due to the mirror prism system
	- Viewfinder does not reflect exposure settings, so you will have no idea if you correctly exposed the image until you review it on the screen
	- Autofocus when shooting video is often not very good

## Mirrorless

- Omits the mirror prism system, instead using the image sensor to create both the viewfinder and back screen images
- Pros
	- Newer technology with greater innovation
	- Better for video due to superior autofocusing capability
	- Lighter and more compact (applies to mirrorless lenses too)
	- Electronic viewfinder (EVF) reflects exposure settings
- Cons
	- More expensive
	- Shorter battery life, as the image sensor is active all the time in order to create the viewfinder image
	- More limited lens selection, as they haven't been around for as long
	- EVF can encounter issues with flicker, seeing nothing in the dark, auto exposure, and being almost unusable in concerts and other types of flashing light events
