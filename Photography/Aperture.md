## What is aperture?

- The aperture of a lens refers to both the hole in the lens where light is able to enter, and the size of said hole
- Essentially the lens's pupil
- A wider aperture results in more light being let in, and thus a brighter image, while a narrower aperture results in less light being let in, and thus darker image

## F-stop

- Aperture is measured in f-stops (e.g. f2), and this number has an inverse relationship to the size of the aperture
	- The lower the f-stop number, the wider the aperture, while the higher the f-stop number, the narrower the aperture
	- Each f-stop number either doubles the amount of light let into the camera compared to the next number, or halves it
	- Lower f-stop lenses are generally larger and more expensive 
- The f-stop number labelled on the lens is the lowest f-stop it can achieve
	- Variable aperture zoom lenses have different minimum f-stops for different focal lengths
		- The higher focal lengths within the lens usually have a higher minimum f-stop than the lower focal lengths
		- E.g. for an 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 lens, it can open up to f3.5 at 18mm, but only f5.6 at 55mm
		- As such, they are usually cheaper than constant aperture zoom lenses, which have the same minimum f-stop number for all focal lengths
	- This is why prime lenses exist, as they can achieve a lower f-stop number for a given focal length compared to a variable aperture zoom lens


## Depth of field

- Aperture also has the side effect of controlling the depth of field of an image, which is the amount of background behind the subject that is in focus (i.e., the amount of background blur behind the subject)
	- A wider aperture results in a shallower depth of field, allowing us to create images where only the subject is in focus and the background is blurry and out of focus
	- A narrower aperture results in a deeper depth of field, allowing us to create layered images with the foreground, middleground, and background in focus
- This is because when focusing on a subject, the light coming from it will be refracted by the lens into its focal point on the sensor, resulting in it being in focus - in contrast, all other light will have a different focal point, meaning that it will diverge before hitting the sensor or not converge, resulting in it being out of focus
	- A wider aperture lets in more diverging light from multiple angles, resulting in a shallower depth of field
	- A narrower aperture lets in less diverging light from fewer angles, resulting in a deeper depth of field
- A wider aperture is good for portraits (where we want the subject to be in focus and the background out of focus), while a narrower aperture is good for landscapes (where we want both the foreground and background in focus)
- A shallower depth of field can also be created by:
	- Moving closer to the subject
	- Having a greater distance between the subject and the background
	- Using a longer focal length (e.g., 85mm for portraits)

## Effect on sharpness

- In general, using an f-stop number near the high or low end of a lens's aperture range will result in less sharp images
- At the high end, this is due to the effects of diffraction
- Increasing the f-stop number a bit from the lowest end will usually result in the sharpest images
- Different lenses are sharp at different f-stop numbers
