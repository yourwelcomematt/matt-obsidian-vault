- Overexpose by 1/3 to 2/3 stops
	- It's okay to blow out a grey sky (just before pure white), as grey can be a bit miserable
	- If the clouds are interesting then don't do this
- Seek out naturally high-contrast environments
	- Usually by shooting from a darker area into a brighter area
	- Shoot 90 degrees to the brighter area, or straight into the brighter area itself
	- E.g., silhouette shots
	- Use low angles to create contrast between the subject and brighter areas
- Seek out colour
	- Opt for one or two colourful objects to brighten up your shot - don't overdo it
- Simplify your scene and have a clear subject
	- Longer focal lengths are useful for this
- Try shooting in the rain
	- More reflections
	- Colours pop more
	- Overall softer image
- Try shooting in black and white
	- Makes you focus on exposure, tonality, and composition
- Editing tips
	- Increase the exposure if it's a bit grey
	- Decrease the shadows for a more contrasty look
	- S tone curve
