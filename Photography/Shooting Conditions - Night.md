## What are the challenges of night photography?

- Night photography is often the trickiest subset of photography to master, as you are put in a bit of a sticky situation when it comes to your exposure triangle settings:
	- A higher shutter speed is usually required to reduce motion blur or hand shake, resulting in not enough light entering the camera
	- Your aperture may not open wide enough, or you may not want to open it that wide in order to maintain a deeper depth of field and focus, resulting in not enough light entering the camera
	- A higher ISO can counteract the previous two issues, but may introduce significant grain and noise

## Tips

- Look for interesting light (or any light really)
	- Shoot into the light for silhouettes
	- Shoot perpendicular to the light for profiles
	- Use your own external light sources if necessary
- You want night time to look like night time, not day time
	- One option is to underexpose the overall image in order to expose for the highlights, and then bring the shadows up in editing, as information is retained in the shadows better than in the highlights
	- This can be done either using exposure compensation or different light metering modes (e.g., spot or centre)
	- Setting the auto ISO to a maximum of 3200 instead of 6400 would work in this scenario
- To reduce the risk of getting a blurry image:
	- Slow down and take your time
	- Hold your camera firmly against you using the viewfinder, extend your your neck strap until it is taut, or lean against something
	- Use burst mode
	- Use the timer function
- Use a tripod 
	- Solves most of the issues associated with night photography, as it allows you to use a significantly slower shutter speed while keeping your aperture and ISO at acceptable levels (aka long exposure)
- Rain is your friend!
	- Make use of reflections
- You don't need an f1.4 lens to shoot at night
	- f2.8 or f2 or good enough in a lot of cases
- Don't be afraid to use high ISOs
	- Usually anything up to and including 6400 is fine
- Be careful and aware of your surroundings
	- Night time is inherently more dangerous
	- Bring a bag with you so you can hide your camera
	- Stick to relatively busy areas or city centres
