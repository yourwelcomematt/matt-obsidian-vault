## What are the challenges of night photography?

- Night photography is often the trickiest subset of photography to master, as you are put in a bit of a sticky situation when it comes to your exposure triangle settings:
	- A higher shutter speed is usually required to reduce motion blur or hand shake, resulting in not enough light entering the camera
	- Your aperture may not open wide enough, or you may not want to open it that wide in order to maintain a deeper depth of field and focus, resulting in not enough light entering the camera
	- A higher ISO can counteract the previous two issues, but may introduce significant grain and noise

## Tips

- Look for interesting light
	- Shoot into the light for silhouettes
	- Shoot perpendicular to the light for profiles
	- Use your own external light sources if necessary
- You want night time to look like night time, not day time
	- One option is to underexpose the overall image so that any light in the scene is properly exposed, and then bring the shadows up in editing (information is retained in the shadows better than the highlights)
	- This can be done either using exposure compensation or different light metering modes (e.g., spot or centre)
	- Setting the auto ISO to a maximum of 3200 instead of 6400 would work in this scenario
- To reduce the risk of getting a blurry image:
	- Slow down and take your time
	- Hold your camera firmly against you using the viewfinder, extend your your neck strap until it is taut, or lean against something
	- Use burst mode
	- Use the timer function
- Using a tripod solves most of the issues associated with night photography, as it allows you to use a significantly slower shutter speed while keeping your aperture and ISO at acceptable levels - this is called a long exposure
