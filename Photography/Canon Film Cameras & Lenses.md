https://high5cameras.com/all-articles/repair/canon-ftb-prism-replacement/

1st gen is better
- All-metal internals
- Smoother film advance lever

Common features between 1st and 2nd gen
- Shockless mirror system which results in almost no vibration or mirror slap when firing the shutter
- Prism foam deterioration like the Olympus OM-1 which shows has two vertical lines in the viewfinder
	- Can replace with an AE-1 prism - need to remove a resin plastic strip at the rear first

## 35mm f2

"One thing to look out for in these fast aperture wide angle FD lenses are rotten roller bushings. Canon used nylon bearings in the focusing cams and over time will it will disintegrate due to age and wear. The signs of this issue is a wobbly, loose focusing ring with rotational play within it. The front lens group barrel will usually be loose and have some play too from the focusing ring helicoid. This results in poor image quality and severe decentering as the lens elements are not perfectly aligned anymore and would need a complete teardown to repair the bushings."
