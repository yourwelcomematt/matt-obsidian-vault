## Aperture Priority

- Allows you to change the aperture and have the shutter speed and ISO adjust automatically
- Most popular priority mode as it gives you the most creative control over how your images look compared to other modes
- Minimum shutter speed
	- If the minimum shutter speed is too low, then you'll get blurry images when shooting handheld
	- Experiment with the minimum shutter speed to find an acceptable value for your camera and lens (1/80 seems to be good for me, but Roman Fox uses 1/200)
- Auto ISO range
	- Minimum ISO should generally be as low as you can go, however you can use a higher ISO at night time to ensure that your shutter speed doesn't go too low (Roman Fox uses 500)
	- Maximum ISO can be 3200 for day time and 6400 for night time, or 12800 for emergencies
- Aperture
	- f4 is a good all-purpose aperture, as it provides a balance between sharpness, bokeh, and light intake, and allows you to adjust higher or lower as needed
	- f1.4-2.8 is best for low light, shallower depth of field, and softness
	- f8-11 is best for harsh light, greater depth of field, and sharpness
- Make use of [[Exposure Compensation|exposure compensation]] when necessary
- Make use of different [[Light Metering (Photometry)|light metering]] modes to achieve certain artistic looks
- Make use of auto exposure lock (AEL), which will allow you to expose for a certain part of the scene and then recompose
	- Note that you can change the AEL button so you don't have to hold it down in the button/dial settings

## Shutter Priority

- Allows you to change the shutter speed and have the aperture and ISO adjust automatically
- Most useful if you need to photograph fast-moving subjects

## Program Mode

- Like an advanced auto mode, allowing you to control ISO, exposure, and autofocus
- Good for point and shoot situations
- When shutter speed is adjusted, aperture is adjusted automatically, and vice versa
