## What is the Zone System?

- The Zone System is a film exposure technique developed by Ansel Adams and Fred Archer that:
	- Allows you to control where detail is retained in the image
	- Should result in a balanced final exposure

## Zones

- We can break an image up into 11 brightness zones running from 0 to 10, with 0 being pure black and 10 being pure white
- Each zone corresponds to a stop of light (e.g., 1/125 -> 1/60 or f2.8 -> f2)
- Zone 5 is what light meters consider "proper exposure", and corresponds to middle-grey
- Zone 3 is the darkest zone that still retains detail
- Zone 7 is the lightest zone that still retains detail

## How to use the Zone System with a spot meter

1. Take spot meter readings of the following parts of the frame:
	1. Brightest part
	2. Darkest part
	3. Multiple in-between parts
2. Pick one of the in-between exposures and consider that to be your correct exposure (Zone 5 or EV 10)
3. Measure the number of stops between the darkest part exposure and your chosen exposure, then minus that from 5 to give you your darkest zone
4. Measure the number of stops between the brightest part exposure and your chosen exposure, then add that to 5 to give you your brightest zone
5. In general, aim for Zone 3 for the darkest part and Zone 7 for the brightest part
6. If you are happy with the zones these parts sit in then you can take the picture using your chosen exposure
7. If the brightest part is in too high a zone, then decrease your exposure accordingly
	1. If the darkest part goes into too low of a zone, then you'll have to decide whether you want more details in the shadows or the highlights
8. If the darkest part is in too dark a zone, then increase your exposure accordingly
	1. If the brightest part goes into too high of a zone, then you'll have to decide whether you want more details in the shadows or the highlights

Can also just go with the approach of metering the darkest part first, underexposing by two stops to Zone 3, and then checking that the brightest part is not more than Zone 7
