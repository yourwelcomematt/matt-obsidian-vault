## What is light metering?

- Light metering is where the camera measures the amount of light in the scene in order to determine the correct exposure
- When shooting in automatic mode, this light meter reading will cause the camera to adjust different exposure settings in order to reach a proper exposure
- When shooting in anything other than automatic mode, then this light meter reading is just displayed as a reference so you can tell if you are underexposed, overexposed, or correctly exposed

## Light metering modes

- Spot metering will measure the light only within a single spot in the scene 
	- Useful for backlit portraits, where the camera would otherwise be tricked into underexposing the image at the expense of the subject
- Average metering will average out the light within the entire scene and use this as the measurement
	- Can be tricked by heavily backlit or contrasty images, or where shadows or highlights dominate over the other, so may not always be accurate
