## What is light metering?

- Light metering is where the camera measures the amount of light in the scene in order to determine the correct exposure
- When shooting in automatic mode, this light meter reading will cause the camera to adjust different exposure settings in order to reach a proper exposure
- When shooting in anything other than automatic mode, then this light meter reading is just displayed as a reference so you can tell if you are underexposed, overexposed, or correctly exposed

## Light metering modes (Fujifilm)

- Spot metering
	- Will measure the light only within a single spot in the scene (need to link the metering spot to the autofocus spot in the settings)
	- Useful for portraits, where the camera would otherwise be tricked into underexposing or overexposing the image when the background is much lighter or darker than the subject, at the expense of the subject
- Centre-weighted metering
	- Measures light from the entire frame but places the greatest weight on the centre area
	- Not many use cases for this
- Multi metering 
	- Measures light based on an analysis of composition, colour, and brightness distribution within the entire frame
	- Recommended in most cases
- Average metering
	- Will average out the light within the entire scene and use this as the measurement
	- Can be tricked by heavily backlit or contrasty images, or where shadows or highlights dominate over the other, so may not always be accurate
	- Provides consistent exposure across multiple shots with the same lighting
	- Particularly effective for landscapes and portraits of subjects dressed in black or white
