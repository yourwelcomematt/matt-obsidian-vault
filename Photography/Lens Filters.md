## What is a lens filter?

- A lens filter is piece of glass that attaches to the front of a lens to protect it from damage and degradation, or to give a different look to photos
- Common types include:
	- UV filters which are used to protect the front glass element of the lens
	- Neutral density (ND) filters which act like sunglasses to decrease the amount of light entering the lens
	- Polarising filters / CPLs which are used to remove reflections in water

## Lens Diameter

- Each lens has a different diameter, thus requiring different a different diameter of lens filter
- Usually marked on the lens
- Instead of buying a lens filter for every lens, a more cost-effective and practical solution is to buy one lens filter for your biggest lens diameter, and then use a step-up ring to adapt the filter to any lens with a diameter less than or equal to your biggest lens
- Alternatively, you can use another adaptive filter solution
