## What is a lens filter?

- A lens filter is piece of glass that attaches to the front of a lens to protect it from damage and degradation, or to give a different look to photos

## Lens Diameter

- Each lens has a different diameter, thus requiring different a different diameter of lens filter
- Usually marked on the lens
- Instead of buying a lens filter for every lens, a more cost-effective and practical solution is to buy one lens filter for your biggest lens diameter, and then use a step-up ring to adapt the filter to any lens with a diameter less than or equal to your biggest lens
- Alternatively, you can use another adaptive filter solution

## Lens filter types

### UV filters

- Used to reduce the effect of UV light on image quality, and to protect the front glass element of the lens from physical damage
- The UV aspect is important for film photography, but basically negligible for digital photography - as such, it's essentially like a screen protector for your phone
- Can cause additional flaring in certain lighting conditions (e.g., at night with bright lights)

### ND (neutral density) filters

- Used to decrease the amount of light entering the lens
- Essentially sunglasses for your camera, except they don't change the colour of the light going through them, hence the use of the word "neutral"
- Allow us to:
	- Use wide apertures in bright environments to achieve a shallower depth of field
	- Use slower shutter speeds in bright environments to achieve greater motion blur or long exposures
- Come in different strengths or darkness levels, which are indicated by a filter factor number or optical density number (refer to the chart in the B&H article which lays out how a given number corresponds to the number of stops of light it reduces the exposure by)
	- A 6 stop ND filter is recommended for landscape photographers
- May be circular and screwed on to the front of the lens, or rectangular and slotted into a special holder attached to the front of the lens
- A variable ND filter allows you to change the amount of light that is blocked by the filter

### Polarising filters

- Also known as CPLs
- Used to:
	- Remove reflections and glare from water, windows, etc.
	- Darken blue skies
	- See farther into water
- Also provides an ND effect
