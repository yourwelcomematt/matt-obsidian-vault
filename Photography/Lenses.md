# Focal Length

- The distance between the focal point of the lens (where light converges) and the sensor of the camera
- Measured in millimetres (mm)
- The higher the mm, the more zoomed in the lens is
- The lower the mm, the more wide angle the lens is

# Aperture

- The size of the hole in the lens where light is able to enter (like the pupil)
- Measured in f-stops (f)
- The lower the f-stop number, the wider the aperture, resulting in more light being let in and a shallower depth of field (i.e. more background blur behind the subject)
- The f-stop number on the lens is the lowest f-stop, and thus widest aperture, it can achieve
	- Variable aperture zoom lenses have different f-stop numbers for different focal lengths

# Prime Lenses

- Have a fixed focal length with no zoom capability
- Advantages
	- Faster
	- Sharper
	- Lower aperture, meaning they are:
		- Better in low light
		- Can achieve a shallower depth of field
- Disadvantages
	- Less versatile

# Zoom Lenses 

- Have a focal length range, allowing them to zoom
- Advantages
	- More versatile
- Disadvantages
	- Slower
	- Less sharp
	- Worse in low light

# Autofocus

- Most lenses are autofocus lenses, which are able to focus on the subject automatically using electronics and a motor
- Manual lenses require you to manually turn the focus ring on the lens to achieve the focus that you want
- Using an autofocus lens on a camera body with an incompatible mount will usually worsen its autofocussing capability, or even turn it into a manual lens

# Mounts
- The mount is the mechanism through which the lens is able to attach to and communicate with the camera body
- Different brands have different mounting systems:
	- Sony - E mount
	- Nikon - Z mount
	- Fujifilm - XF mount
