## TTL

- Through The Lens means that the camera meters the scene and tells the flash how much power to use
- Flash compensation allows you to adjust the power of the flash

## Manual

- The exposure triangle becomes an exposure square
- Aperture controls how much light from the flash is let into the camera
- Flash power should be adjusted as needed
	- Should always be adjusted before the aperture, as the aperture has a greater effect on the creative aspect of your photo
	- If it can't be adjusted any further then adjust the aperture
- Shutter speed only controls the exposure of the background
	- It doesn't matter what shutter speed you are using as long as you are shooting at or below the maximum sync speed of the camera - the amount of flash will be the same
	- This is because at all shutter speeds at or below the maximum sync speed:
		- When the flash fires, the shutter curtains will always be fully retracted and the sensor fully exposed
		- The flash will always fire immediately after the front curtain retracts, or right before the rear curtain closes, depending on which setting you choose
	- Because these variables are constant, this means that the shutter speed will have no effect on the amount of light being let in from the flash, as the duration and power of the flash will always be the same; however it will still have an effect on the amount of ambient light in the background
	- If you are shooting above the maximum sync speed, then the shutter curtains will start to appear in the frame and cause black banding
- ISO should be kept as low as possible

Expose for the amount of ambient light you want in the background first, then dial in the amount of flash you want
