## What is ISO?

- Back in the days of film photography, different film stocks had different light sensitivities, and this light sensitivity was referred to as ISO
	- A film stock with a low light sensitivity required a lot of light to correctly expose an image,  thus requiring the use of low shutter speeds and a tripod in low-light situations
	- A film stock with a high light sensitivity did not require as much light to correctly expose an image, making it more suited for low-light situations
- Nowadays, ISO refers to the light sensitivity of the image sensor in the camera, which is a result of the amount of voltage/current running through it and can be adjusted
	- Technically this is actually sensor gain, as the image is being digitally boosted
	- ISO is hugely valuable, as you will often be using a particular aperture to achieve a certain look, and a particular shutter speed to reduce blurriness or shake, and will thus be reliant on ISO to achieve a correct exposure in the end


## What ISO should I use?

- A lower ISO number indicates lower sensitivity to light and thus darker images
- A higher ISO number indicates higher sensitivity to light and thus brighter images
- The downside of using a higher ISO is that it introduces more digital noise (signal interference) into images, which is often undesired, however this is often necessary in low light situations
	- This is because a sensor with high light sensitivity will become too sensitive and start to pick up all light around it and generate heat
	- Like a volume knob, where high volumes result in feedback and distortion
	- Generally occurs at ISO 6400 and above
	- Also reduces dynamic range (i.e., how much detail is retained in both the shadows and highlights)
- Different cameras have different levels of ISO performance, and the ISO at which the camera looks its best and has the greatest detail and dynamic range is called the base or native ISO
	- E.g., 200 ISO for Fujifilm cameras
	- Sony cameras can generally be used at higher ISO numbers than other cameras while still retaining good image quality, which is especially useful in low-light settings
	- The base ISO for photography and video within a single camera is often different
- You should use the lowest ISO possible to achieve the exposure you want
- Shooting at a high ISO makes it difficult to recover a JPEG image in post if it is underexposed, as boosting the shadows or brightness will just result in lots of grain. If you're shooting at a high ISO, try to make sure that the image is properly exposed at the time.
