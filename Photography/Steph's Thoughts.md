- Recommends starting with a mirrorless
	- Especially if wanting to upgrade in the future, as the future of photography is mirrorless
	- Can do so much more with mirrorless, especially in low light settings
	- Fewer selection of lenses compared to DSLR; however, you can use an adaptor for DSLR lenses (she doesn’t recommend this)
	- Mirrorless will be more expensive
	- Sony has good starter cameras
- Recommends getting a more expensive DSLR instead of a starter one, as:
	- A starter one can’t do much once you get the hang of it
	- An iPhone can do a better job at times, as it can actually shoot in low light settings
	- Starter cameras are usually APS-C, not full frame, so worse low light performance
	- Won’t be able to maximise higher end lenses when you get there, and would need to get a better camera at this point anyway
	- Overall, it is more cost effective to get a mid-range DSLR to start with rather than a starter one
- DSLR choices
	- Canon 1500D and Nikon D3500 are both extremely similar in specs – she doesn’t recommend either but if she had to, she would choose the Nikon, as:
		- It has higher focus points
		- Allows for higher ISO levels, although these levels will often compromise image quality, therefore this point shouldn’t be taken into consideration
		- Canon 200D is similar as well – would still recommend the Nikon
	- Nikon D5600 is her recommendation for a first DSLR
- Mirrorless choices
	- Doesn’t recommend Nikon for entry level as they are unnecessarily expensive
	- Canon EOS RP is pretty good from what she’s heard, but she’s not too familiar with Canon’s mirrorless range
	- Sony has been making mirrorless cameras the longest and would be a reliable choice
	- All entry level mirrorless cameras are quite similar and will pretty much do the same thing
	- Recommends getting a full frame mirrorless camera and the one with the best battery life, since battery life is shorter for mirrorless cameras
- Summary
	- DSLR
		- Canon 6D or Nikon D600
		- Nikon D5600
		- Nikon D3500
	- Mirrorless
		- Any one as long as it is full frame, has good battery life, and is a decent price

Follow-up questions
- With regards to DSLR vs mirrorless for a beginner: in terms of learning, I’ve heard that a DSLR might be better since you can’t see a preview of what the image is going to look like before you take the shot (if you use the viewfinder), therefore you would be forced to learn how to read the conditions and adjust the camera settings appropriately. What are your thoughts on this?
	- That’s true, however throughout your photography journey you slowly develop an intuition of what settings should be used instead of relying on the viewfinder anyway, so I wouldn’t get a camera that does less just to learn faster
	- What’s most useful is to shoot in manual mode
- Following on from that, it seems like the APS-C sensor size is pretty common and still looks decent from what I’ve seen. Another advantage seems to be that cameras containing APS-C sensors tend to be lighter and smaller, which could improve the likelihood of wanting to carry the camera around and use it in the first place. Do you think I need a full frame camera as a beginner, taking into account the price increase and other factors?
	- Full frame can do more and accommodate more lenses, whereas a cropped frame would lower the performance of a lot of lenses and defeat the purpose of getting some lenses like portrait lenses
	- If you get to the point where you’re carrying around multiple lenses, the weight of the camera doesn’t really bother you
	- If you’re starting off and don’t want to discourage yourself, then a lighter cropped frame one might be better
	- Keep in mind though that you may want to change cameras pretty soon, however you can just sell the old one in this case
- And in terms of a mirrorless camera choice, the Sony A6000 series (including the 6100/6300/6400/6500/6600) seem to be very popular, however they are known to not have very good battery life. Do you have any other specific mirrorless recommendations that are not full frame?
	- Nikon Z50 (cropped) and Z5 (full frame) have the best performance for a beginner mirrorless camera from what I’ve heard, even for a cropped lens, and have good battery life; however they are quite pricey
	- I use a Nikon Z6 and the battery life is great
	- I’ve heard good things about Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV and Sony A6100 (haven’t heard complaints about battery life, but I can check with my friend who uses it!
