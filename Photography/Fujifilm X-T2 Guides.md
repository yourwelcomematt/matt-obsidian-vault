- To customise the buttons: hold down the DISP/BACK button
	- Start with the defaults until you figure out what works for you and what doesn't
- Editing software (Lightroom doesn't play nicely with X-Trans sensors)
	- Capture One
	- Luminar
	- Fujifilm X Raw Studio
- To edit images in camera: hold the Q button when viewing an image
- Shadows in the JPEGs can be a bit dark: -1 shadow

## First 15 things I set on a brand new Fujifilm camera. (Omar Gonzalez)

- Sound settings
	- Turn off AF Beep
	- Turn off Electronic Shutter Sound
- AF/MF settings
	- Use the maximum number of focus points (hybrid and contrast-based)
	- AF+MF allows you to autofocus and then adjust using manual focus
- Back button focus
	- Button/Dial Settings -> Shutter AF -> on for AF-S, off for AF-C
	- Can be in either AF-C or Manual all the time
- AF area
	- All allows you to use the rear dial to change between the different AF area types (e.g., single point, zone, wide)
- Shutter types
	- M+E allows you to use much higher shutter speeds 
- To use non-Fujifilm lenses: Button/Dial settings -> Shoot Without Lens ON
- To prevent shooting without an SD card: Shoot Without a Card OFF

## Finally embracing AUTO ISO on my Fujifilm. (Omar Gonzalez)

- Noise Reduction
	- Tends to make things pasty at high ISOs
	- Recommend turning it all the way down to -4, which is off
- If you're using auto shutter speed as well, then the camera can override the minimum shutter speed you set in order to get a correct exposure - override this manually if needed

## Turn these settings OFF on your Fujifilm camera

* Don't use lossless compression as macOS and iOS have trouble previewing and working with them
