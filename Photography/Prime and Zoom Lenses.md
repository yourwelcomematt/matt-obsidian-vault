## Prime Lenses

- Have a fixed focal length with no zoom capability
- E.g. 50mm
- Advantages
	- Have fewer lens elements, and thus are able to produce sharper images
	- Have larger apertures (typically ranging from f2.8 to f1.2), meaning they are better in low light and can achieve a shallower depth of field
- Disadvantages
	- Less versatile
	- Zooming must be done by moving the camera

## Zoom Lenses

- Have a variable focal length, allowing them to zoom in or out by adjusting various lens elements 
- E.g. 18-55mm
- Advantages
	- More versatile, as you can shoot a wide range of focal lengths without having to change your lens
	- Saves time, as you don't have to change your lens as often
- Disadvantages
	- Have more lens elements, resulting in them producing less sharp images
	- Have smaller apertures (typically only up to f2.8), meaning they are worse in low light and cannot achieve as shallow of a depth of field
	- Usually bigger and heavier
	- More analysis paralysis, where you can't decide which focal length to use

### Parfocal zoom lenses

- Able to keep the subject in relative focus while the focal length is changed
- Not as common and very expensive

### Varifocal zoom lenses

- Unable to keep the subject in relative focus while the focal length is changed
- Far more common
