## What is sharpness?

- The sharpness of an image is how clear it is (i.e., the lack of blurriness), or how clearly detail is rendered

## Factors the influence sharpness

### Shutter Speed

- Shutter speed is one of the most significant contributing factors towards the sharpness of an image
- Lower shutter speeds result in blurrier images, as:
	- Things in the image have more time to move while the camera is still capturing the image
	- Your hands have more time to shake and move the camera while it is still capturing the image
- If you find that your images are blurry, try using a higher shutter speed

### Focus

- If something is not in focus, then it will never be sharp

### Gear

- Different lenses have different levels of sharpness, and will influence sharpness more than the camera body
- Higher megapixel cameras will generally be able to produce sharper images with more detail than lower megapixel cameras

### Still Subjects

- E.g. architecture, landscapes, still life
- It's easier to get a sharp image if the subject is not moving 
- The main cause of blurriness in this case will be your body's natural shake, as well as any wind
- A general rule to compensate for this shake is to not use a shutter speed that is lower than 1 / focal length of your lens
	- If you want to be safe go 1/2 a stop or a full stop faster - this is actually preferable
	- When shooting at a higher focal length (e.g. a telephoto lens), go 2 or 3x faster
- Image stabilisation allows you to decrease your shutter speed if you're shooting a still subject, as it also counteracts this shake, or you can use a tripod
- Use single autofocus (AF-S) or manual focus, as the distance to the subject will not change

### Moving Subjects

- E.g. portraits, people, street photography, sports
- Use the lowest shutter speed that will allow you to freeze the action properly
	- In general, start at 1/400 and move up from there
	- The larger the subject is in the frame and the faster the subject moves through the frame, the faster the shutter speed you'll need (1/1000 and above)
	- Use continuous autofocus (AF-C) to track the subject and ensure that they are always in focus

It's super important that you take a few test shots and make the appropriate adjustments!
