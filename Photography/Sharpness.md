## Shutter Speed

- One of the most significant factors towards the sharpness of an image
- Lower shutter speed results in blurrier images, as:
	- Things in the image have more time to move
	- Your hands have more time to shake

## Focus

- If something is not in focus, it will never be sharp

## Gear

- Different lenses have different levels of sharpness, and will influence sharpness more than the camera body

## Still Subjects

- E.g. architecture, landscapes, still life
- It's easier to get a sharp image if the subject is not moving 
- The main cause of blurriness will be your body's natural shake, as well as any wind
- A general rule to compensate for this shake is to not use a shutter speed that is lower than 1 / focal length of your lens
	- If you want to be safe go 1/2 a stop or a full stop faster - this is actually preferable
	- When shooting at a higher focal length (e.g. a telephoto lens), go 2 or 3x faster
- Image stabilisation allows you to decrease your shutter speed if you're shooting a still subject, as it also counteracts this shake
- Use single autofocus (AF-S) or manual focus, as the distance to the subject will not change
	- AF-S uses a single point for autofocus

## Moving Subjects

- E.g. portraits, people, street photography, sports
- Use the lowest shutter speed that will allow you to freeze the action properly
	- In general, start at 1/400 and move up from there
	- The larger the subject is in the frame and the faster the subject moves through the frame, the faster the shutter speed you'll need (1/1000 and above)
	- Use continuous autofocus (AF-C)
		- AF-C will ensure that the selected point is continuously in focus

It's super important that you take a few test shots and make the appropriate adjustments!
