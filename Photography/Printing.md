## Preparing photos for printing

* Don't worry about calibrating your monitor unless you have a dedicated print monitor
* Raise the exposure of your photos (1/3 to 1/2 stop), as we're used to viewing photos on backlit screens which emit light as opposed to prints which reflect light and are naturally darker
	* Darkening your monitor and decreasing it's contrast can also help make the displayed photo closer to the printed photo
	* Increase the blacks, shadows, contrast, and colour if necessary
	* If the highlights are clipping then decrease them
	* Some videos recommend over-sharpening, but others recommend not doing this
* Magnify the image and look for any dust spots or blemishes which need to be removed
* Resize the image
* JPEG is fine except for very large prints
* 300 DPI is recommended, although you can go lower when printing larger

## Paper options

- Matte
	- Best for black and white
- Semi-gloss/lustre
	- Good middle ground
- Glossy
	- Best for vibrant or colourful images

## Where to print

* Best to outsource to a printing lab, as having a large photo printer at home is usually not very cost-effective due to ink and paper costs
	* Do test prints so that you can determine how to prepare your photos and what paper you like the most
* If you do want to print at home, then the Canon Selphy 1500 is a good option for postcard-sized prints
