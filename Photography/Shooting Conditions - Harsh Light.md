- Increase your exposure if possible without blowing out the highlights
	- Proper exposure can actually look more dull and less true-to-life
	- Best to do this when editing
- Simplify your scene
	- Harsh light can make detailed scenes look more cluttered
	- Longer focal lengths work better
- Try to find diffused light
	- E.g., light reflecting off of a building
- Don't try to make high contrast scenes low contrast, and vice versa (mainly when editing)
	- Can double-down and make high contrast scenes even higher contrast for a more arty look, and vice versa - can use spot metering for this
- Use a warmer white balance
- Use a lower aperture to soften the background a bit
	- Can use an ND filter to help with this
