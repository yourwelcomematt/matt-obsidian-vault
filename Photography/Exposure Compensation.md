## What is exposure compensation?

- Exposure compensation is a setting that allows us to adjust the overall exposure of the image without having to touch aperture, shutter speed, or ISO
- Extremely useful when in automatic or priority modes
	- In automatic mode, it will change whatever setting it deems necessary
	- In aperture priority, it will change the shutter speed or ISO
	- In shutter priority, it will change the aperture or ISO
	- In auto ISO, it will change the ISO
- Usually adjusts exposure by a third of a stop at a time, although this can be customised
