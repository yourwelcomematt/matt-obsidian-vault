## What is exposure compensation?

- Exposure compensation is a setting that allows us to adjust the overall exposure of the image
- Extremely useful when in automatic or priority modes
	- In automatic mode, it will change whatever setting it deems necessary
	- In aperture priority, it will change the shutter speed and/or ISO
	- In shutter priority, it will change the aperture and/or ISO
	- In auto ISO, it will change the ISO
- Usually adjusts exposure by a third of a stop at a time, although this can be customised
- Unless you're using a Fujifilm film recipe that calls for a specific exposure compensation value, try to avoid going greater than + or - 1 stop

## Rough recommendations

- Normal daylight: + or -1/3
- Harsh daylight: -2/3 to 0
- Overcast/cloudy conditions: 0 to +2/3
- Snow: +2/3 to 1 (as the camera will normally underexpose)
- Fog: +1/3 to 2/3 (as the camera will normally underexpose)
