## Exposure compensation

- Used in automatic, shutter priority, and aperture priority modes
- Allows you to adjust the exposure when in a mode that doesn't give you full manual control
- Also allows you to adjust the exposure in manual mode when ISO is set to automatic

## Focus area

- Determines where the camera will look to try and find something to focus on
- Wide - uses all available autofocus points (i.e. the entire frame)
- Zone - uses the autofocus points in a zone that you can move around the frame
- Centre - uses the autofocus points in the centre of the frame
- Flexible spot - like centre except you can move it around

## Focus mode

* Single-shot AF (AF-S)
* Continuous AF (AF-C)
* Automatic AF (AF-A)
	* Combination of AF-S and AF-C
	* The camera starts out in AF-S, and then if it detects any movement it will switch to AF-C
* DMF
	* Combination of autofocus and manual focus
	* Can focus on a subject using autofocus and then adjust using manual focus
* Manual focus

## Face Detection

- Will detect faces in the frame, indicated with a white square
- When AF-C is enabled, focusing on the face will turn the square green and enable the camera to continually focus on the face

## Eye AF

- Works when the focus area is set to wide and the focus mode is set to AF-S
- Requires remapping one of the custom buttons to eye autofocus
- Pressing this button detects and focuses on the closest eye in the frame

## Lock-On AF

- Enables you to track moving subjects
- Works when the focus area is set to wide and the focus mode is set to AF-C
- Locking on to and off of a subject is achieved using the middle button of the control wheel

## SteadyShot

- Not recommended when the camera is on a tripod, as there is a chance that the lens will move during a shot (e.g. taking a landscape photo)

## ISO

- Multi Frame NR (Noise Reduction)
	- Labelled as ISO Auto
	- Specialty mode for low light photography
	- Takes multiple pictures and combines them to try and reduce noise/grain
- Auto
	- Camera chooses the ISO based on the conditions
	- We can configure a custom ISO range that the camera must use

## Metering Mode

- Evaluates the highlights and the lowlights in the scene and tries to come up with an optimum exposure
- Commonly used with program mode, aperture priority and shutter priority
- Multi
	- Looks at the entire scene and picks the most balanced exposure for everything in it
- Centre
	- Looks at the centre of the frame and ensures that only that part is exposed correctly, at the cost of everything else
- Spot
	- Like centre except you can see the exact spot where the camera is measuring the light

## White Balance

- Tells the camera what kind of light you're shooting under so that it can get an accurate white point
- Ensures that your colours are accurate
- Higher = warmer, lower = cooler
- Auto
	- Works best outdoors in bright light situations
	- In every other scenario it's best to adjust the white balance based on the type of light that you're shooting under
- Shade
- Cloudy
- Incandescent
- Fluorescent
- Custom
	- Useful if you know the specific Kelvin of the light that you're shooting under - this information can be found on your lightbulbs
- Custom Setup
	- Enables you to carry out a custom WB measurement
	- Should be used alongside a grey card, which has no colour shift and will improve the accuracy of the measurement

## Bulb Mode

- Used for long exposures by opening and closing the shutter for a specific amount of time
- During the day this allows you to:
	- Smooth falling water
	- Capture clouds streaking across the sky
- At night this allows you to:
	- Capture car and star trails
- Accessed in Manual Mode by decreasing the shutter speed all the way until you reach the bulb setting
- Press the shutter to start the exposure and release the shutter to end the exposure
- Using a remote and a tripod is preferred in order to avoid camera movement
- During the day it is recommended to use a really dark ND filter (9 or 10 stop) in order to prevent overexposure

## Monitor Brightness

- By default we can increase the brightness of the LCD screen by two stops
- We can increase this even further by changing the Brightness Setup from Manual to Sunny Weather

## Stopping the Camera From Turning Off Automatically

- Change Pwr Save Start Time

## Delete Images

- We can delete multiple images at once, and images with the same date

## Format Memory Card

- Once all of your images have been offloaded from your memory card, an easy way to delete all of them and reset your memory card to its ideal settings is to format it

## Memory Recall Mode

- Allows you to save recipes of settings for different scenarios
- We can save up to three recipes at a time
- Choose your desired settings, then go into Memory and select the number you want to save it under

## Lens comp.

- Contains various settings to correct your images 
	- Shading Comp. corrects vignetting in the corners of your images
	- Chromatic Aberration Comp. corrects color fringing in your images
	- Distortion Comp. corrects lens barrel distortion in your images
