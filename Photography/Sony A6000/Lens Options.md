## Which lens should I choose?

- Just use the kit lens, which is usually an inexpensive zoom lens (e.g. 18-55mm) that comes with the camera, as:
	- It's more versatile
	- You don't yet know what focal lengths work for your particular situation and style of shooting 
- For an APS-C camera, a 35mm is often better than a 50mm, as the 35mm is a 52.5mm full-frame equivalent
	- Wider field of view
	- Wider depth of field
	- However, the longer focal length of the 50mm will give more background compression


## Sony Options

- Zoom
	- Sony E PZ 16-50mm F3.5-5.6 OSS (SELP1650)

	- Sony E 18-105mm F4 OSS Power Zoom

	- Sony E 50mm F1.8 OSS (SEL50F18)
	- Sigma 30mm f1.4
