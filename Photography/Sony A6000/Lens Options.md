## Which lens should I choose?

- Just use the kit lens, which is usually an inexpensive zoom lens (e.g. 18-55mm) that comes with the camera, as:
	- It's more versatile
	- You don't yet know what focal lengths work for your particular situation and style of shooting 
- For an APS-C camera, a 35mm is often better than a 50mm, as the 35mm is a 52.5mm full-frame equivalent
	- Wider field of view
	- Wider depth of field
	- However, the longer focal length of the 50mm will give more background compression

	- Good upgrade from the kit lens
	- Zooming is internal, so the lens doesn't get bigger as you zoom in
	- Not that good in low light and can't get lots of bokeh
	- Heavy
