## What is the image sensor?

- The image sensor is the component within a camera that records light information coming in from the lens and converts it into an image
- We can see where the sensor is situated in the camera by looking for a circle symbol with a horizontal line through it on the top of the camera
- The physical size of the image sensor is called the sensor size, and this has many effects on the images you take

## Image sensor sizes

### Full-Frame

- Same size as 35mm film, which is considered the standard
- The most expensive common sensor size
- Wider field of view than other sensor sizes
- Compared to an APS-C sensor with the same resolution, a full-frame sensor will have bigger pixels due to its larger size, resulting in:
	- Greater detail and dynamic range
	- Better low-light performance
	- Less noise
- Commonly believed to be able to achieve greater bokeh than smaller sensor sizes, however this is [[Bokeh|technically not the case]].
- Camera brands that manufacture full-frame cameras include Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, and Leica

### APS-C

- 1.5x smaller than a full-frame sensor, resulting in a 1.5x crop to the resulting image
- Results in a smaller form factor camera than a full-frame camera
- Can achieve the same level of brightness in low light as a full-frame sensor at a given f-stop value, however the noise will be greater
	- To counter this, we would need to reduce the f-stop value by a whole stop in order for us to be able to reduce the ISO and subsequently the noise in the image
- Camera brands that manufacture APS-C cameras include Canon, Nikon, Sony, and Fujifilm

### Micro Four Thirds

- 2x smaller than a full-frame sensor, resulting in a 2x crop to the resulting image
- Lenses for micro four thirds cameras usually come in much lower focal lengths due to the 2x crop
- Often considered to have inferior image quality to larger sensor sizes, however this is not the case
- Camera brands that manufacture micro four thirds cameras include Panasonic and Olympus

### Medium format

- Larger than full-frame
- Camera brands that manufacture medium format cameras include Fujifilm
