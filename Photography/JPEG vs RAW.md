## JPEG

- JPEG (also known as JPG) is an image file format that uses lossy compression to store images
- This means that while JPEG image sizes are small, some image data is permanently lost, resulting in decreased image quality
- In practice, this decrease in image quality is not very noticeable, especially if the images are only going to be viewed on a screen and not made into large prints
- Where this decrease in image quality is noticeable is when editing the files, as there is a lot less image data to work with, resulting in a decreased ability to manipulate the images and obtain the exact look that you want (e.g., bringing up shadows and decreasing highlights)

## RAW

- RAW is an image file format that stores all of the light data recorded by the image sensor
- Because no processing is applied to the images, they require editing to make them look good
- While this results in large file sizes, the benefit to this is that it gives you a lot of image data to work with when editing the files, resulting in a greater ability to manipulate images
- Most cameras give you the option to shoot in both RAW and JPEG, which is a good middle ground
