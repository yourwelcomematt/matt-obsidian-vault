## DSLR vs mirrorless vs rangefinder

- The implementation of the viewfinder is the main difference between a DSLR camera and a mirrorless camera
- In a DSLR, the viewfinder image is created using a mirror prism system, which takes exactly what the lens is seeing and reflects it up to your eye
	- This means that you are seeing the real world as if you were looking directly at it
	- The downside to this is that you cannot see how your settings are affecting exposure in real time, and have to check it after taking the image
- In a mirrorless camera, there is no mirror prism system; instead, the image sensor is recording video at all times and displaying this through the viewfinder, which is actually a small screen within the camera 
	- This means that you are not seeing an exact representation of the real world, however the advantage of this is that you can see how your settings are affecting exposure in real time
- In a rangefinder camera, you are looking directly at the scene through a small glass window in the side of the camera, which has markings to indicate the field of view of the lens that you're using
	- Requires correcting for parallax, as the viewing window is offset from what the lens is seeing

## Diopter

- A diopter is an optical tool which adjusts the camera's viewfinder to suit your eyes, allowing you to see a clear and focused image without needing glasses
- In most modern cameras, the diopter wheel is located right next to the viewfinder
- Should be used if you find the viewfinder is blurry - in particular the symbology (i.e. ISO, shutter speed, grid, etc.)
