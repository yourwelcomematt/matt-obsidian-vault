- "It's a spring next to the mirror box vibrating. There a small rubber damper that's supposed to sit against the spring to stop it doing this, but over time the rubber hardens and the damper loses its effectiveness."
- "Fix would involve taking the camera apart, mirror box out, and renewing the piece of rubber."
