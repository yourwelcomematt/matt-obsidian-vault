## How should I shoot portrait photography?

- Ideal focal lengths for portraits are longer focal lengths such as 50mm and 85mm, as they are more flattering to the human face than shorter focal lengths such as 16mm, which tend to enlarge the face in an unnatural way
- A shallow depth of field is often preferred for portraits, as it offers better separation between the subject and the background; as such, a wider aperture is usually used in combination with a longer focal length
