- SD cards are the dominant type of memory card these days, and are the primary storage medium used by cameras
- Choosing the right SD card is key, as choosing the wrong one can cripple the performance of your camera

## Capacity

- Capacity ranges from 8GB all the way up to 2TB
- Recommended Capacity:
	- 32GB or 64GB for photography
	- 128GB or more for videography
- Large capacity cards are usually used by wedding photographers, sports photographers, wildlife photographers, or anyone else who needs to shoot thousands of photos a day

## Speed

- Measured in megabytes per second (MBps or MB/s)
- Read speed
	- How fast data can be read off of the card
	- Important when transferring photos onto your computer
- Write speed
	- How fast data can be written to the card
	- More important than read speed when choosing an SD card for a camera, as the write speed will determine how quickly you can view your photos, as well as how fast you can shoot and for how long (i.e. in burst mode)

### UHS-I/II/III

- Stands for Ultra High Speed
- The interface used to connect to SD cards
- Newer UHS version cards have extra pins, allowing them to achieve faster speeds
- UHS-I is the slowest, while UHS-III is the fastest
- You'll only get the extra benefit of a newer UHS version if the device you're using the SD card in also supports that newer version
- UHS is backwards compatible, so you can use newer UHS version cards in older UHS version devices, however you'll only get the older UHS version speeds

### Speed Class Rating Systems

- Designed to help buyers choose a card that is suitable for use in cameras by indicating the minimum write speed of the card
- Unfortunately, there are multiple speed classes that are a confusing series of overlapping letter and number categorisations
- Speed Class
	- The first and most basic form of SD speed class categorisation
	- Consists of a "C" (for class) followed by a number, which denotes the minimum write speed of the card
	- The highest class, C10, indicates a minimum write speed of 10MB/s, which is why it is not really used anymore, as this speed is far too slow for modern cameras
- UHS Speed Class
	- Consists of a "U" followed by a number, which denotes the minimum write speed of the card
	- There are only two UHS speed classes:
		- U1 indicates a minimum write speed of 10MB/s
		- U3 inidicates a minimum write speed of 30MB/s
	- Different to the card's UHS interface version
- Video Speed Class 
	- Named because recording high resolution video is often the most demanding operation a camera and memory card can perform
	- Consists of a "V" followed by the minimum write speed of the card in MB/s (e.g. V30)
- Any camera with V30, V60, or U3 should be fast enough for photography

## Classifications

- SD (Secure Digital)
	- 2GB capacity
	- Not used anymore
- SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity)
	- 4-32GB capacity
	- Uses the FAT32 file system format
- SDXC (Secure Digital eXtended Capacity)
	- 64GB - 1TB capacity
	- Uses the exFAT file system format

## Durability

- Many manufacturers make their cards resistant to dust, moisture, x-rays, and more to help protect your data in a variety of conditions

## Formatting

- Allows you to free up space and set the card up in the way the camera wants and expects (e.g., by creating a certain folder structure)

Sony a6000 considerations
- Has a single UHS-I SD card slot, so won't be able to take advantage of UHS-II cards
- Max write speed is around 34 MBps
- Only officially supports memory cards that go up to 64GB
- Requires an SDXC card in order to shoot XAVC S footage
