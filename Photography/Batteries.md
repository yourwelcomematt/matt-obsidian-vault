## First-party batteries

* These are batteries that are manufactured by the actual camera brand (e.g., Sony)
* Considered more reliable than third party batteries, as they generally hold a longer charge and have a longer lifespan
* The main downside is that they are usually more expensive than third party batteries

## Third party batteries

* These are batteries that are not manufactured by the actual camera brand
* Main selling point is that they are way cheaper than first party batteries while supposedly offering similar performance
* However, they often hold a shorter charge and have a shorter lifespan, and have been found to have reliability and consistency issues

## How many batteries should I get?

- For a mirrorless camera, get at least two spare batteries to be safe, as they go through batteries faster than DSLR cameras

## Film camera batteries

SR44 is better than LR44 as the voltage discharge is constant over time
