## Equipment

- Digital camera
	- Already have - Fujifilm X-T2
- Macro lens w/ 1:1 magnification

	- https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/15kffp3/experience_on_ttartisan_40mm_macro_for_dslr/
	- Vintage macros include Canon FD 50mm f3.5 and Nikkor 55mm f3.5, however they both need one extension tube to achieve 1:1 magnification
- High CRI light source
	- Cinestill one is meant to be good
- Film holder
	- Essential Film Holder
	- Valoi 35mm Holder (also comes in 120)
	- Valoi sells a kit via Kamerastore which contains the Cinestill Light Source + 35mm Holder, however it's sold out as of 27/04/25
	- https://kamerastore.com/products/starter-kit-1
- Tripod or copy stand or enlarger
	- Need a tripod anyway so could be a good excuse
	- Tripod needs to have the ability to flip upside down
	- Apparently enlargers are cheaper and easier to adjust

## Software

- Negative Lab Pro plugin for Lightroom

## Scanning Process

1. Set the camera up on the tripod or copy stand so that the lens is facing down
2. Place the light source underneath it
3. Place the film holder on top of the light source
4. Ensure that the camera is directly parallel to / level with the light source and film holder (can use a mirror for this)
5. Try to turn off or reduce any other lights in the room
6. Insert the film strip into the film holder so that the first frame is illuminated (emulsion side up apparently - need to research this more)
7. Turn the camera on
8. Move the camera up or down until the whole screen is filled with the first frame (leave a bit of border around it though)
9. Camera settings
	1. RAW
	2. Lowest ISO to reduce digital noise (e.g., ISO 100 or 200)
	3. Aperture of f5.6-11 to ensure maximum sharpness - f8 is a good middle ground
	4. Shutter speed on auto
	5. Exposure compensation +1/2 to +1 stop (optional but suggested by Kyle McDougall)
	6. Manual focus + focus peaking
	7. Remote shutter release or self-timer to reduce camera shake from pressing the shutter release button
10. Adjust focus until the grains in the film are sharp (can use max aperture like f2.8 to ensure critical focus before stopping down to take the image)
11. Use a blower to remove any dust from the film
12. Take the image using the remote shutter release or self-timer
13. Repeat Steps 1-11 for the remaining images

Comment from Teo Crawford's video:
- "There's a trick to level your camera, you can use a small mirror and place it on top of where the film will be and once the reflection of your lens is in in the middle of the frame of your camera, it is perfectly leveled."

## Editing Process

1) Import the images into Lightroom
2) Use the auto white balance dropper and click on the border of the image (non-photo part of the film) to set the white balance
3) Open the Negative Lab Pro plugin and change the following settings (if required):
	1) Colour Model: Replicates colour profiles of different scanners. Frontier or Noritsu are good choices.
	2) Pre-Saturation: Can be left as default but Teo Crawford said to use the highest setting, as the default can be a bit desaturated.
	3) Border Buffer: Choose a value that removes the border from around the image. This ensures that the conversion is not affected by the border.
4) Click "Convert Negatives"
5) Edit the converted image to taste using the available settings
	1) Kyle McDougall likes the Linear profile
	2) Uncheck "Make Copy"
	3) Turn off sharpening
6) Click "Apply"
7) Crop the image to remove the border
8) Sharpen the image (Amount = 80-100 and Radius = 1.5)
9) Export to JPEG

From TTArtisan 40mm macro Reddit post:
- "A little tip for processing the RAF files. I import the files from the SD card to Capture One Express (free Fujifilm license), and export them as TIFFs to convert with Negative Lab Pro in Lightroom. It avoids the worming problem with Lightroom and RAF files."
