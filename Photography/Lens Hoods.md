## What is a lens hood?

- A lens hood is a plastic or metal cone that attaches to the front of a lens in order to prevent unwanted stray light from going across it and causing lens flares and/or washed-out images
- Like holding up your hand above or next to your eyes to reduce glare, resulting in increased contrast and saturation
- Also helps protect your lens from getting damaged by providing physical protection
- Usually comes with the lens

## When should I not use a lens hood?

- When you want lens flares for artistic effect
- To reduce size and avoid attention
- When using the flash, as the lens hood can cast a shadow on the subject

## Lens hood types

- Flower/pedal hoods
	- Commonly found on wide angle lenses
	- Strike a balance between shading the lens and not appearing in the shot
- Cone hoods
	- Commonly found on long-range zoom lenses
	- Don't need the cut-outs of flower hoods, as they are never wide enough to be at risk of appearing in the shot
