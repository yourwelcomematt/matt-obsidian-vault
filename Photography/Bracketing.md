## What is bracketing?

- Bracketing is where the same image is taken multiple times at different exposures
- These can then be combined in post to achieve an HDR look, or you can just choose the best one to use
- Generally consists of three photos taken with a single shutter press - one at the set exposure, one that is overexposed by one stop, and one that is underexposed by one stop
