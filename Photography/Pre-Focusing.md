## What is pre-focusing?

- Pre-focusing is where you focus on a specific area or spot in the frame before a subject moves through it, upon which you can take the shot without having to re-focus
- Allows you to anticipate moments and capture them, as autofocus is often not reliable in these kinds of situations
- Useful when you find a nice composition or scene but just need a subject, which is likely to be moving through the frame (e.g., in street photography)
- Should be used in conjunction with back button focus
- Can be used with wide apertures, however narrower apertures will give you more leeway in terms of your plane of focus
- Easier with wider focal lengths
- Kind of like zone focusing, except with zone focusing there is a zone of focus between the camera and a set distance, which allows you to capture anything within that distance

## Pre-focusing approaches

1) Manual focus on a specific area
2) Autofocus on a spot with the shutter button and hold the AF-L button (autofocus lock)
3) Autofocus on a spot with back button focus using a single press, which will lock autofocus without having to hold down the AF-L button
