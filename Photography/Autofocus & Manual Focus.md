## Autofocus

- Most lenses are autofocus (AF) lenses, meaning they are able to focus on a subject automatically using electronics and motors
- Different lenses have different kinds of motors, resulting in varying levels of sound when focusing - this can be annoying when shooting video, as the motor sound may be loud enough to show up in the video
- Using an autofocus lens on a camera body with an incompatible mount via an adapter will usually worsen its autofocusing capability, or even turn it into a manual lens

### Camera autofocus modes

- Single autofocus (AF-S) will cause the camera to lock focus on a specific subject or part of the frame, and not refocus even if the camera or subject moves
	- This makes this mode more suitable for stationary objects, as well as objects moving in 2D space
- Continuous autofocus (AF-C) will cause the camera to focus on and track a specific subject or part of the frame, in order to ensure that it is always in focus 
	- This makes this mode more suitable for objects moving in 3D space 

### Camera autofocus area options

- Single point / spot allows us to move a single focus point around the frame (usually of moderately variable size), and then when autofocus is activated the camera will focus on whatever is within that point
	- Provides the greatest precision
	- Great for portraits
- Zone allows us to move a larger autofocus square containing multiple focus points around the frame, and when autofocus is activated the camera will focus on whatever is within that square 
	- Good for focusing on moving subjects  
	- Not as good for precision, as the camera can still get confused
- Wide uses all available focus points and leaves it up to the camera to automatically detect and focus on a subject within the entire frame 
	- Least precise, although brands such as Sony and Canon excel in this area
	- Best for subjects that are against a high contrast background

## Manual Focus

- Manual focus (MF) lenses require you to manually turn the focus ring on the lens to achieve the focus that you want
	- Usually cheaper
	- Greater control
	- Can focus in conditions where autofocus struggles (e.g. in low light or if the subject lacks contrast)
- Most cameras with autofocus lenses give you the ability to switch between autofocus and manual focus, either via a physical switch or in the camera's menus
	- However, the focus ring on autofocus lenses is not mechanically linked to the lens; instead, it sends a signal to the camera, which then changes the focus within the lens, which is called focus-by-wire

## Minimum Focusing Distance

- The closest the camera can be to a subject and still be able to focus
- Measured from the sensor, not the lens
- Usually marked on the side of the lens with a circle with a line through it, along with the word "macro" or a flower symbol
- In general, the shorter the focusing distance, the greater the background blur (bokeh)
