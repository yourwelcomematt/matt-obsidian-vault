## Autofocus

- Most lenses are autofocus (AF) lenses, meaning they are able to focus on a subject automatically using electronics and motors
- Different lenses have different kinds of motors, resulting in varying levels of sound when focusing - this can be annoying when shooting video, as the motor sound may be loud enough to show up in the video
- Using an autofocus lens on a camera body with an incompatible mount via an adapter will usually worsen its autofocusing capability, or even turn it into a manual lens

### Camera autofocus modes

- Single autofocus (AF-S) 
	- Will cause the camera to focus on a specific subject or part of the frame, and not refocus even if the camera or subject moves
	- This makes this mode more suitable for stationary objects, as well as objects moving in 2D space
- Continuous autofocus (AF-C)
	- Will cause the camera to focus on a specific subject or part of the frame, and track it to ensure that it is always in focus 
	- This makes this mode more suitable for objects moving in 3D space 
	- Note that this will only track the subject while it is within the specified autofocus area (e.g., zone or wide), and can hunt when trying to focus on stationary objects
	- For Fujifilm the default AF-C setting is the best for most situations

### Camera autofocus area options

- Single point / spot 
	- Where the camera will focus on whatever is within a single movable focus point
	- The size of this point can usually be changed, however a smaller point is best for accuracy
	- Provides the greatest precision but is not very responsive
	- Great for still objects (e.g., portraits) and slow-moving objects where you have plenty of time to compose
- Zone
	- Where the camera will focus on whatever is within a larger autofocus square containing multiple focus points
	- The size of this zone can usually be changed
	- Great for focusing on moving subjects and/or in fast-paced environments
	- Not as precise, as the camera can get confused by what it's meant to focus on, however it's very responsive
- Wide
	- Where the camera uses all available focus points to automatically detect and focus on a subject
	- Usually covers the entire frame
	- When used in combination with AF-C it can be very useful for tracking moving subjects
	- Least precise of the area options, although brands such as Sony and Canon excel in this area
	- Best for subjects that are against a high contrast background

### Auto Focus Lock (AF-L)

- Will cause the camera to lock focus, allowing you to recompose and shoot while still retaining the initial focus
- Often mapped to a button which can either be held down or pressed once to lock and once to unlock

### Release/Focus Priority

- Choosing release priority will allow you to shoot even if focus hasn't been acquired
- Choosing focus priority will prevent you from shooting unless focus has been acquired

## Manual Focus

- Manual focus (MF) requires you to manually turn the focus ring on the lens to achieve the focus that you want
- Advantages
	- Provides greater control
	- Can focus in conditions where autofocus struggles (e.g. in low light or if the subject lacks contrast)
	- Can use zone focusing
	- MF-only lenses are usually cheaper
- Disadvantages
	- Generally slower
	- Often requires focusing aids such as peaking, split prism, punch-in, etc.
- Virtually all autofocus lenses can also be switched to manual focus, either via a physical switch or in the settings; however, the focus ring is not mechanically linked to the lens, and instead sends a signal to the camera which changes the focus of the lens (AKA focus-by-wire)

## Minimum Focusing Distance

- The closest the camera can be to a subject and still be able to focus
- Measured from the sensor, not the lens
- Usually marked on the side of the lens with a circle with a line through it, along with the word "macro" or a flower symbol
- In general, the shorter the focusing distance, the greater the background blur (bokeh)
