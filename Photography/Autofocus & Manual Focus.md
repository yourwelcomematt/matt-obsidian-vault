## Autofocus

- Most lenses are autofocus (AF) lenses, meaning they are able to focus on a subject automatically using electronics and motors
- Different lenses have different kinds of motors, resulting in varying levels of sound when focusing - this can be annoying when shooting video, as the motor sound may be loud enough to show up in the video
- Using an autofocus lens on a camera body with an incompatible mount via an adapter will usually worsen its autofocusing capability, or even turn it into a manual lens

### Camera autofocus modes

- Single autofocus (AF-S) 
	- Will cause the camera to focus on a specific subject or part of the frame, and not refocus even if the camera or subject moves
	- This makes this mode more suitable for stationary objects, as well as objects moving in 2D space
- Continuous autofocus (AF-C)
	- Will cause the camera to focus on a specific subject or part of the frame, and track it to ensure that it is always in focus 
	- This makes this mode more suitable for objects moving in 3D space 
	- Note that this will only track the subject while it is within the specified autofocus area (e.g., zone or wide), and can hunt when trying to focus on stationary objects
	- For Fujifilm the default AF-C setting is the best for most situations

### Camera autofocus area options

- Single point / spot 
	- Where the camera will focus on whatever is within a single movable focus point
	- The size of this point can usually be changed, however a smaller point is best for accuracy
	- Provides the greatest precision but is not very responsive
	- Great for still objects (e.g., portraits) and slow-moving objects where you have plenty of time to compose
- Zone
	- Where the camera will focus on whatever is within a larger autofocus square containing multiple focus points
	- The size of this zone can usually be changed
	- Great for focusing on moving subjects and/or in fast-paced environments
	- Not as precise, as the camera can get confused by what it's meant to focus on, however it's very responsive
- Wide
	- Where the camera uses all available focus points to automatically detect and focus on a subject
	- Usually covers the entire frame
	- When used in combination with AF-C it can be very useful for tracking moving subjects
	- Least precise of the area options, although brands such as Sony and Canon excel in this area
	- Best for subjects that are against a high contrast background
- All
	- Specific Fujifilm mode which allows you to easily switch between the above options by changing the size of the focus area using the rear command dial

### Auto Focus Lock (AF-L)

- Will cause the camera to lock focus, allowing you to recompose and shoot while still retaining the initial focus
- Often mapped to a button which can either be held down or pressed once to lock and once to unlock

### Release/Focus Priority

- Choosing release priority will allow you to shoot even if focus hasn't been acquired
- Choosing focus priority will prevent you from shooting unless focus has been acquired

## Manual Focus

- Manual focus (MF) requires you to manually turn the focus ring on the lens to achieve the focus that you want
- Advantages
	- Provides greater control
	- Can focus in conditions where autofocus struggles (e.g. in low light or if the subject lacks contrast)
	- Can use zone focusing
	- MF-only lenses are usually cheaper
- Disadvantages
	- Generally slower
	- Often requires focusing aids such as peaking, split prism, punch-in, etc.
- Virtually all autofocus lenses can also be switched to manual focus, either via a physical switch or in the settings; however, the focus ring is not mechanically linked to the lens, and instead sends a signal to the camera which changes the focus of the lens (AKA focus-by-wire)

### Zone Focusing

- A technique for manual focusing which involves pre-setting your in-focus zone a certain distance away from you using the focus ring, and pre-setting the size of the zone using the aperture, allowing you to take photos of any objects within the zone without having to focus again
- When in aperture priority mode, this essentially turns your camera into a point-and-shoot
- Usually used in street photography where there isn't as much time to compose or focus
- Settings
	- A higher aperture should be used to ensure that the in-focus zone is as big as possible - f11 is usually recommended, but you made need to use f8 or lower on days that aren't sunny, or at night
	- A higher shutter speed should be used to ensure that your images aren't blurry - minimum 1/125 of a second is recommended
	- Wider angle lenses (e.g., 35mm full frame equivalent and lower) are best as they provide a greater depth of field than higher focal lengths
- MF-only lenses usually have hyperfocal distance markings, which will tell you the near and far limits of your in-focus zone for a given aperture as you move the focus ring
	- On the focus ring you'll have distance in feet and metres
	- Below the focus ring you'll have your aperture range extending from the largest aperture in the centre to the smallest aperture, which is mirrored on both the left and the right
	- Match your aperture on the left side with the number on the focus ring to see your near limit
	- Match your aperture on the right side of the range with the number on the focus ring to see your far limit - note that if this is infinity then you are at the hyperfocal distance and everything from the near limit and beyond will be in focus
	- The number on the focus ring that's in the middle is the middle of your in-focus zone, which will be the sharpest
	- If your lens doesn't have these markings, then you can use zone focusing tables or apps
	- You'll likely need to practice in order to accurately gauge distances
- Fujifilm cameras (and probably other brands) will tell you the distance and size of the in-focus zone when in manual focusing mode

## Focusing Distance

- The focusing distance, or the distance between the camera and the object you want to focus on, helps determine the depth of field
- When focusing on a close object with lots of stuff in the background, no matter what the aperture is there will still be background blur
	- To reduce background blur, use a narrow aperture and focus more towards the middle of the frame to increase the likelihood of objects falling within the wider depth of field
- When focusing at a certain far distance away from the camera, everything beyond this point will be in focus no matter what aperture you use - this is called infinity (e.g., beyond 10m)
- When focusing on a far object with lots of stuff in the foreground within the infinity distance, then there will be foreground blur
	- To reduce foreground blur, use a narrow aperture - note that you won't be able to get rid of all of it though if the foreground objects are close to the camera or far away from the subject
- You can use the distance scale in your camera to evaluate this

### Minimum focusing distance

- The closest the camera can be to a subject and still be able to focus
- Measured from the sensor, not the lens
- Usually marked on the side of the lens with a circle with a line through it, along with the word "macro" or a flower symbol
- In general, the shorter the focusing distance, the greater the background blur (bokeh)
