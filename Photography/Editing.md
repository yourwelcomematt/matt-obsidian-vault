1) Crop first to remove unnecessary or distracting objects from the scene
2) Adjust the exposure and white balance, as these have the most significant impact on the end result
3) Apply lens corrections where necessary (i.e., for vignetting and barrel distortion when using a wide aperture or wide lens respectively)
4) Make the biggest changes first, then fine tune, otherwise you may have to undo work you've already done
5) Edit specific parts of the frame where necessary (e.g., increasing the luminance of a particular object using the subject mask feature in Lightroom), however be aware of the effect on the overall image

## Serr Film look

1) Tone curve
	1) S shape
	2) Bring the blacks up
2) Increase the highlights and decrease the whites to retain detail

4) Move dehaze to the left
5) Move clarity left for softness or right for punch
6) Move vignette to the left
7) Add some grain
8) Choose daylight or tungsten white balance and adjust as necessary

Paolo's advice
- Warmer
- Make greens less yellow, decrease luminance, and maybe increase saturation
