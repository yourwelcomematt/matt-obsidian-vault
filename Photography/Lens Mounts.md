## What is a lens mount?

- The lens mount on a camera body is the mechanism through which the lens is able to attach to and communicate with it

## Lens mount systems

- Different brands have different mounting systems, even between their own full-frame and APS-C camera lines:
	- Sony - E mount (APS-C and full-frame)
	- Canon - RF mount (full-frame)
	- Nikon - Z mount (APS-C and full-frame)
	- Fujifilm - X mount (APS-C)
- In general, a lens built for a specific mounting system cannot be used on another system, however nowadays most brands have lens mount adapters that allow you to overcome this
- While several brands allow you to use both full-frame and APS-C lenses on the same mount, each of these comes with its own trade-offs:
	- Using a full-frame lens on an APS-C camera will not be taking full advantage of the lens, as only a small section of the light that the lens receives will actually be used by the sensor
	- Full-frame lenses are also usually bigger than APS-C lenses, potentially nullifying the advantage of using a smaller and lighter APS-C camera
	- Using an APS-C lens on a full-frame camera will not be taking full advantage of the sensor, as the lens will only be able to cover a small section of the sensor with light, thus reducing the resolution of resulting images
