Heya, sorry for not getting back sooner about the camera recommendations! Been busy and also had to do a bit of research.  
  
In terms of fixed-lens film cameras that also have manual mode, the annoying thing is that most of them only take mercury batteries which you can't get any more. This means you have to use modern batteries that either don't give accurate light meter readings, or last for a very short time. As such, you'd probably end up shooting without a battery in full manual, meaning you either have to read the light by eye to determine what settings to use, or use a light meter app on your phone. This is what I do for my Canon rangefinder in the leather case, however I wouldn't recommend it for someone starting out.

As such, I'd probably steer clear of those and go with a manual focus SLR from the 70s with interchangeable lenses, since they're the most common, are good quality (metal + durable), and take modern batteries. You could consider an SLR from the 80s or 90s that has autofocus, but these are usually a bit bigger, plasticky, and rely heavily on electronics.

Here are the options I came up with:

- Nikon FE
	- Great camera that's not too big or heavy while feeling durable and well-made
	- Takes 2x LR44 or SR44 batteries which are easy to find - will only work on one shutter speed without batteries
	- Can be used in either aperture-priority mode or manual mode
	- Aperture-priority is super useful as it means you don't have to worry about changing the shutter speed - all you have to do is set the lens aperture and the camera takes care of the rest (kind of semi-auto)
	- Nikon FM is the fully mechanical version of the FE that only needs batteries for the light meter, but has no aperture-priority mode
- Pentax MX or ME Super
	- In terms of size and weight these are the best - super small and light
	- Take 2x LR44 or SR44 batteries which are easy to find
	- MX is fully mechanical and manual and only needs batteries for the light meter
	- ME Super has aperture-priority and manual modes, but requires batteries to operate (will only work on one shutter speed without batteries) and the controls aren't as nice to use
- Pentax Spotmatic
	- Super common and cheap
	- Fully manual and can be operated without batteries
	- Battery powers the light meter, however the light meter can be iffy since these cameras are quite old
	- Takes 1x PX625A battery which is easy to find
	- Bit bigger than the other options but still not too big

I have the Nikon FE, Pentax MX, and Pentax Spotmatic, and can vouch for all of them
- If size and weight are the most important, then I'd go with the Pentax MX or ME Super
- If price is the most important, then I'd go with the Pentax Spotmatic
- For an all-rounder, I'd go with the Nikon FE or FM

All three have a good range of lenses, with Nikon probably having the widest range. For a first lens that's common, compact and cheap, I'd go with a 50mm lens. If you're buying the camera with a lens, this is the lens that will normally come with it.

In terms of where to buy them, you can look on Trade Me or FB but it's always a bit risky. You never know how the camera has been treated, when it was last serviced, or what underlying problems there may be. Buying from a physical store is good because you get a warranty (usually 3 months). Progear in Newmarket and Auckland Camera Centre in Kingsland are my recommendations (Progear in particular). I wouldn't recommend buying from Junktion as from my experience, everything is overpriced and not kept in the best condition. It is handy for going to try out a camera you're looking at buying though.

Progear currently has a silver Nikon FE + 50mm f1.4 lens for $368 which is a good deal: https://www.progear.co.nz/shop/shnikfesai5014k-8-nikon-fe-silver-ai-50mm-f-1-4-lens-grade-8-20944?category=35&order=create_date+desc#attr=22279,22282,22283

Otherwise I have a black Nikon FE + 50mm f1.8 lens that I was looking at selling. I just need to replace some of the light seals and test it first.

Junktion has Spotmatics, MEs (predecessor to ME Super), ME Fs (variant of the ME Super), and FE2 (successor to the FE) that she could go try out in person, as well as a whole range of other cameras.
