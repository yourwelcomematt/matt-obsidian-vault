## X-T20 / X-T30

- Not that comfortable due to the smaller grip
- Lacks ISO dial
- Viewfinder is a bit cramped
- Shutter sound is not as nice
- Command dials feel pretty good

## X-T2

## X-T3

- Very comfortable - not as heavy or big as I thought
- ISO dial!
- Good viewfinder
- Quiet but nice shutter sound
- Rear command dial depresses a bit when you turn it, front command dial is good
