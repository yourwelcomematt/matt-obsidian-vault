### Connecting a PS4 controller

**Bluetooth**
Put the controller in pairing mode by pressing and holding the PS and Share buttons until the light bar flashes. Then, on your Mac, go to Bluetooth settings and select the controller from the list of nearby devices. When the controller is paired, the light will stop flashing and remain steady.

**USB**
Use a micro USB to USB-A cable to connect the controller to a Mac with a USB-A port. For a PS5 DualSense controller, you'll need a USB-C to USB-C cable and a Mac with a USB-C port.
