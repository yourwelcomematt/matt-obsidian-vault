Hi baby,

Many apologies for the card, but as soon as I saw it I knew I had to buy it (look how happy they look!) :D

Darling I've been so amazed at what you've achieved over the past few years, and seeing you grow into your new career makes me so proud.

every day you make me want to be the best person I can be

You're the funniest, nicest, weirdest, and most gorgeous girl I've ever met, and every day I feel do lucky that we found each other and get to live our lives together.

I love you so much and I hope you had/have an awesome birthday 

Love from Matt <3
