Southern Cross
- Do I keep the old one or the new one?
	- Ideally I want to keep the history from the old one
	- If I keep the old one will the premium still be around $40?
	- Am I able to keep the old one if the new one is the primary policy holder? Can this be switched?


Notes from what they've told me
- Error where the billing was backdated to Dec 2022 and sent out the invoice automatically
- Don't need to pay it - ignore the invoice
- Back to $44.58
