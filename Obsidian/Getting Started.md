## What is Obsidian?

- Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files

## Vaults

- A vault is a folder on your local file system where Obsidian stores your notes
- You can keep all your notes in one vault, or create several vaults for each of your different projects

## Notes

- Notes in Obsidian are stored as plain text files
- Obsidian supports [[Markdown]], which is a markup language for adding formatting to plain text files
- Type `Cmd+N` to create a new note
- We can view multiple notes at once by dragging and dropping them into tiles

## Links

- The true power of Obsidian lies in being able to link your notes together
- By understanding how one piece of information relates to another, you can improve your ability to remember them and to form deeper insights
- Use double square brackets to create a link
	- Alternatively, select some pre-existing text and type `[[` to convert it into an empty link, then use `Cmd` click to create the note to link to
	- Use the pipe symbol after the link name to change the display text
- Click the link to go to the note, or `Cmd+Opt` click to open the note alongside the current note 
	- Hold `Cmd` while hovering over the link to see a preview
	- We can also embed the contents of the link by putting an ! before the link
- To create a link to an external URL, enclose the link text within square brackets and follow this immediately with the URL enclosed within parentheses
- To create a link to a heading within the same note, use the # symbol after the link name followed by the header
- To create a link to a block of text within the same not, use the ^ symbol after the link name followed by the text at the start of the block

### Backlinks
- Use the backlinks tab in the right side bar to navigate to notes that have links to the current note
- We can view both linked mentions and unlinked mentions

## Images

- We can add an image to a note by dragging and dropping it
- Under the hood this is an embedded link to the file

## Graph View

- Another way to navigate between your notes is by using a visual representation of how your notes are connected, which is called the Graph View
	1. Select **Open graph view** in the ribbon in the left sidebar.
	2. Click any of the nodes in the graph to navigate to that note.
