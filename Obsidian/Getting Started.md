## Linking Notes

- The true power of Obsidian lies in being able to link your notes together
- By understanding how one piece of information relates to another, you can improve your ability to remember them and to form deeper insights
- Use double square brackets to create a link
	- Alternatively, select some pre-existing text and type `[[` to convert it into a link
	- If the link is empty, `Cmd` click to create the note to link to
- Click the link to go to the note, or `Cmd+Opt` click to open the note alongside the current note 
- Use the backlinks tab in the right side bar to navigate to notes that have links to the current note
- Another way to navigate between your notes is by using a visual representation of how your notes are connected:
	1.  In the top-right corner of the note, click **More options** (three dots).
	2.  Select **Open local graph**.
	3.  Click any of the nodes in the graph to navigate to that note.
