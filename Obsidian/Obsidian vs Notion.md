## Obsidian

- Pros
	- Mainly used for note-taking
	- Everything is written in Markdown, simplifying the text editing process
	- All files are stored locally, resulting in increased privacy and portability, and allowing you to work offline
	- More lightweight, resulting in faster performance
	- Easier to get started
	- Better search functionality
	- Wide range of themes and plug-ins, resulting in greater customisability and allowing you to completely change the look and feel of the app

- Cons
	- No multi-device sync - you have to pay for a monthly subscription if you want this, or use GitHub or another cloud storage service 
	- Formatting is less user-friendly, as you have to remember Markdown syntax - may not be as intuitive for non-programmers
	- Switching between editor and view mode can be a bit of a hassle - would recommend live view mode
